Obamacare made America sick in more ways than 1. The Republicans will fix your mess and make healthcare great again
Republicans have no plan!
Actually they do, although even no plan would be light years better than the ACA which is in a death spiral
Actually, enrollment in 2016 is up and Republicans can't agree.
Republicans don't agree on when, how to replace Obamacare - CNN https://apple.news/AIJHi9ocvSOW3YAIW7aWUZw …
Liberals care more about people having health insurance and care very little about them getting health care
That makes no sense.
Makes perfect sense when you can not afford the massive deductibles and out of pocket expense of ACA.
I know a lot of people with ACA who have low deductibles and copays.
with all due respect, your democrat president dismantled our healthcare system years ago...time to replace obamacare.
it appears you have your marching orders from your master instead of your constituents
What healthcare do you have?
I would say that the better question is, "What healthcare does @SenStabenow have?" ACA?
I'm actually more interested in what you have.
The point is not what I have, but the value of ACA. What's good for the goose...
If you see the polls, u would see that most people want to keep it.My friends are not deadbeats or welfare recipients.
POLLS?...really, do you mean the same polls that assured a victory for HRC?  Have a nice life...
Obamacare is a disaster.  The people have shown they want it replaced.  Your fake righteousness is evident.
Then why is enrollment up? People need health insurance. Repealing with no plan to replace it is irresponsible.
@SenSchumer you're making Americans broke again
And yet enrollment in these states has increased in 2016.
Fight for us, please!
Republicans are drunk with power right now they forget there is an election in two years!!!
YEAH,BUT THEY CAN SCREW EVERYBODY OVER ,BIG TIME FOR 2 YEARS,AND STUPID PEOPLE WILL VOTE THEM IN AGAIN.CRAZY .
I don't think he will make it to 2 year's, impeachment is a step away
PASSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE TOO WEAK TO GO 4 IMPEACHMENT,IF RUSSIA,COMEY,DID IT 2 THEM,THEY'D BE CALLING 4 NEW ELECTION
@SenSchumer there was a healthcare system before your terrible ACA program. Liberals: Good ideas, terrible implementation.
Please explain to me rationale of repealing Obamacare when most Americans want to keep it? Who is the GOP representing?
@SenSchumer Desperate to keep a failing unlawful program .Listen to the People.that's why your party loss!
Thank you! Americans can support the ACA by taking survey at Paul Ryan's office...takes only a few minutes! 608-752-4050  
we don't support the ACA-that's why Hillary lost
yeah right! Where were you today, when MI challenged the validity of the electoral vote?
Stop the lies, YOUR Obamacare, as Gruber said, passed due to stupidity, was a failed attempt for single payer.
Best wishes to you Sen. Stabenow.
Debbie, thank you for defending Americans' right to health!  Keep up the good work.
Thank you @SenStabenow and @SenSchumer for standing up to greedy Republicans, fighting #TheGoodFight for the people.
LMAO!!!
if it such a great healthcare plan, you and your colleagues sign up ok?
it needs to be dismantled, it's horrible
OBC may not be perfect but for those who need it, it's everything. We r going 2b punished for a Dem as POTUS now?
This is disgusting and so hurtful.
fools. Yoh.list now we need to get rid of the rest if the swamp!
OMGosh, were do you old wealthy elitist goats come from? Healthcare is more expensive for the young&middleclass than ever.
and leave many deaths I their path.
You ma'am are a CLOWN in the Army of Head CLOWN @SenSchumer!#CHUCKIEtheCLOWN!
We were great 8 years ago b4 Gov got involved. Docs/hospitals serve everyone.
Have you been to DMV, Social Services, Passport office? We don't need lines for health
The Dems/Libs are not listening to their voters. Gov stay out of our HealthCare.
@SenSchumer The time can't come soon enough for this to be repealed. Terrible law that is straight up tyranny #repealobamacare
@SenSchumer POS Obama care should have never been enacted  it's all on the Democrats
Affordable is very questionable and remember the promise that you can keep your doctor? All those broken promises...truly sad..
WHO, @SenStabenow, could call AZ's 110% ins.rate hike "affordable"? & WHEN did America "get well" 2b able2 become "sick AGAIN"? #Obamacare
Reckless Republicans...claim they want to cut costs...but then they hold expensive hearings for political grandstanding!
Trash Trump, Keep ACA
Without ACA-I would have gone w/o coverage.Tell them we do not need people dying due to callous indifference. That's the truth!
how much do you pay yearly for health insurance? Exactly what I thought ,zero
your time has come and gone . Proof is in the pudding . Affordable Health care is joke with  High deductibles
sick and tired of low class getting more benefits than middle class at a free price .
WNY overwhelmingly voted for Trump
I am sicker everyday under the unaffordable care act . Listen to the people that make up the largest sector .
We must look at downstream effects of repealing #ACA & Repubs underlying aim is to weaken Medicaid. #Eldercare
Repugs got their healthcare plan off working poor!So its 2 hell with everyone else!Let people die off!Cuts down population!
@305Pirate If it isn't broken don't replace it
@SenSchumer dismantle oca?Its already a shambles and near collapse Any responsible bldng inspectr would condemn this firetrap
U want to dismantle the middle class. ACA is unaffordable, useless. You hv more uninsured now then b4 aca! Costs up every yr
@SenSchumer yay!  I hope the GOP does dismantle it.  It was a lie from the beginning.  We need free market healthcare.
blame the idiot's that voted for the dummy, he gets all his up dates from t.v., watches a lot of t.v. #moronidiot
If It Was So Great Why Are You Exempt?
ACA is exactly what GOP would design if they could. Lobbyists defend it, ins, drugs, hospitals, doctors, 66% or more of voters
When healthcare is forced on people it is called fascism, if ObamaCare was so great more the 20mill would be on it voluntarily
Trump and the GOP want to make America sick again.
Before you stick your foot in your mouth, Google AHCRA. Rhetoric and BS we don't need. Got it on passage
How can you say that? You don't even know what their plan is. ACA should be know as the unaffordable care act UCA!
Be our voice!  They don't have a mandate.  54% of voters voted against this!
America needs & deserves a Health CARE Plan, not this shameless For-Profit Health INDUSTRY Plan run by Gamblers & Leeches
ACA made possible for me to care FT for my elderly parents/keep in  home.  I have BRCA & need yearly mammo & mri.
Remind them  the OBAMACARE TAX ( Judge Roberts) called passed (Jonathan Grubber) because of stupidity of voters.
Our premiums have doubled in MN to $840 per month. UNAFFORDABLE! What don't you understand?
yes and you lied.If you start praying now God will forgive you but people wont
Thank you.  Keep up the fight. I'd like to see more publicity around those whose lives were saved by ACA.
Democrats are doubling down on stupidity. Obamacare is great. WOW!!!!!!!
@SenSchumer Liars No one wants people to be sick
Knock it off Debbie.
I support & benefitted from the ACA. It's not perfect, but that doesn't mean we need to Repeal, we need to REVISE #ilovetheACA
Make sure to bring up the face that Obamacare is a TAX!  We the people "don't want it".
Your party doesn't get what last 3 election was all about in part. ACA will go away.
Obamacare is a pathetic mess, it has made America sick again, and only a moron doesn't see that.
The US sick care system is an embarrassment.
@SenSchumer 
Thank you for fighting the good fight! We're behind you!
How pathetic of a socialist does one have to be to decry a proposal to return to capitalism?
STAND R GROUND!
Why don't you propose that you & all senators & Congressmen use ObamaCare. Bet it won't happen bc you know it's crap.
@SenSchumer fyou signed a 3,000 plus document without reading the damn thing you don't have a clue get off your soap box
@SenSchumer It's the people's plan! There is a reason why Democrats had their asses handed to them in the last three elections!
don't be stupid,Obama care has made our health care R & D so much worse, we're going wrong way
Fight them every step of the way!!
the Democrats have made America sick with Obama care, ruining the best HC system in the world.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@SenSchumer 
@SenSchumer Dem get heads out of Obama's butt y'all already loop holed over 100,000 retired auto workers loss Thier coverage

The Dems are making us sick by having J Gruber call all of America "Stupid" for passing it.We're sick of you crooks
For 8 years, the Republicans have been trying to repeal ACA.  8 years later...still no plan on how to replace it.
Boss. Let's America Think Again.
You must not have Obamacare or "forced" to have it under this terrible law. Or You could just afford it, we cannot!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If it's so great, why did members of congress EXEMPT themselves from it? Talk to your constituents
@SenSchumer they are opportunistic villains-they stand behind a man who is disgusting - couldn't even make this up if you tried
Hey Schumer, if it is so affordable, why are you not using it?  Hypocrite? Same for Stabenow
@SenSchumer STOP calling it the AFFORDABLE Care Act.That's a smack in the working man's face! It was ALL based on DEMOCRAT LIES
Grow up guys, acting like the stupid entertainers as your threat isn't working.Obamacare stinks, deductions high.
@SenSchumer Work in the medical field and U people are the biggest BULLSHIT artists. Pay ATTENTION, IT'S A FING MESS!Stop LYING
@SenSchumer the GOP has no skills to govern, only tear down and obstruct
Thank you Senator Stabenow
Fight to keep the ACA! And block every conservative SCOTUS appointment!
thank you
LOL! Obamacare made America sick, sicker and sickest and stabbed the wallets of hard working MIDSDLE CLASS! U LOSE

GOP wants to go back to the era where the ER was another form of insurance
YES YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL AT MAKING MORE AMERICANS SICK!
Yes we are sick we can longer afford to go to a dr. Thanks to you!  YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DR. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR INS.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer WHY DONT YOU DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , WORK WITH REPUBLICANS TO FIX IT.
@SenSchumer YOU PEOPLE WOULD NEVER PUT YOUR FAMILIES ON THIS HEALTH CARE., MAN UP! And stop lying!
@SenSchumer AMERICANS WHO WORK HARD CAN NO LONGER AFFORD HEALTH CARE THEY CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE TRUTH!
@SenSchumer THESE PEOPLE COULD CARELESS ABOUT AMERICAS HEALTH CARE.  THEY SINGLE HANDILY DESTROYED IT!
@SenSchumer LOOK HOW THEY DESTROYED AMERICANS HEALTH CARE! They continue to shove it down our throats!
@SenSchumer Why aren't these people who passed this law on this OBAMA care insurance!  I'll TELL YOU WHY!They wouldn't have it!
@SenSchumer We AMERICANS are sick, we can't afford to go to the Dr. on OBAMA Care.
R's: Repeal Obamacare!
R voters: HELL YEAH!
R's: We will replace ACA...with...something
R voters: Wait. Wut???
Obamacare is chaos. It's a huge failure
@ObamaPleaseStay Go get 'em Senator Stabenow! Keep the ACA and repeal the 2016 election!
Thank you for speaking up for the majority.
If they insist on repealing the #ACA, repeal Congress' insurance. #UnInsureCongress
@SenSchumer How about you speak about these Hillary supporters > https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ2FL7kctYg …
Thank you..Please don't let them take away Obamacare.
@SenSchumer #clueless and out of touch.
@SenSchumer I thought I could keep my doctor!!!
@DrCosmicCharlie @NWGreenApple @RitchieJodi @coratagge Where were you when people's policies were canceled w/out notice?
Thank you!  The ACA has helped so many.
5 big LIES-----that the Democrats told about the new health care law

@SenSchumer What makes me sick again. Obamacare. High deductibles = no real insurance. Its just a scam.
@SenSchumer Dems screwed it up Dems should take the credit where credit is due. Obamacare does not work. Dont blame Reps.
America made it perfectly clear what we were sick of on November 8th (hint: it was you) #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
they want us all to die so they can make jack in the box taco knock offs with us
@SenSchumer you work FOR the ppl and the ACA isn't affordable and YOU know it.The premiums R up as well as deductibles.
@SenSchumer  Yeah, we believe that tag line, just like we believed this...
You arent listening to the people! We cant afford it! 5000 deductibles! 5000 in premiums for 1 person!
It's unfortunate that you don't understand what Obamacare is doing 2 business huge cost 2 Americans. Just keep losing elections
fighting for lesser evil Obamacare when we should have had single payer but #Obama & Dems betrayed us
Wish you dems could see the idiocy you're pushing and how ignorant you look. And you wonder why ppl turning backs on dems.
@SenSchumer let ACA fail all on its own because it is self imploding as is and then it's on the Dems..problem solved
@SenSchumer You liars didn't hear the american people. @TheDemocrats @CNN @ABC @GOP @adjunctprofessr
suggest a plan where smokers and obese people pay double.That should bring premiums down on those who take care of themselves.
All our best, Senator Stabenow!!!
.@SenStabenow .@SenSchumer you know what we're sick of? Far Left Progrressives going too far. It's broke and you didn't bother to fix it.

@sheilad715 totally support you
@SenSchumer nothing much will get changed in two years so I'm looking forward to them trying. There are more important issues.
Senator what Obama care plan do you have for you and your family?
@SenSchumer #DemocratsMakeAmericaSickAgain
You and your Demonrat friends have lied to the American people repeatedly about this wondrous plan that NO ONE WANTS
Good for you and thanks
Look at damage done by repealing ACA in just 3  out of 50 of  our United States of America 
#MakeAmericaSickAgain
.@SenStabenow @naacpgr Quit playing defensive game. Take the fight to the GOP with populist message: Medicare for All!
Blackburn's Twitter poll clearly supports the ACA. Will she listen to her constituents?
Please don't let them take my health care! Been fighting for 3yrs to get SSDI, but can't get Medicare for 2yrs after that.
I hope all trump supporters on aca lose it. We won't even get into Medicare or SS. They wanted it they got. Go fish
@SenSchumer Thank you Senator for looking out for us.
Obama is responsible for this mess in healthcare.  Trump will clean up Obama's mess.
@SenSchumer I'm sure most American would rather lose it then half to pay those outrageous premiums. Repeal!! Repeal!!Repeal!!
@SenSchumer stop the lies. Premiums have skyrocketed and are UNAFFORDABLE
I think the motto should not be negative- I'm a democrat and want positive slogan
@SenSchumer mention the saps like middle class now who can't buy healthcare because you and Pelopi and that other jackass Reid
@SenSchumer Which obamacare plan do y'all have?  Everone else can't afford $20000 before obamacare kicks in. #schmuck
@realDonaldTrump Obamacare is terminally ill. #FullRepeal Also, MI voted for Trump. Guess u don't plan to stay in DC too long.
