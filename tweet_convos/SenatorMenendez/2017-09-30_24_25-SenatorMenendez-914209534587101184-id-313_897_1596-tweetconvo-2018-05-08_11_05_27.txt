How did you use bold in a tweet?

Totally agree! Bush was negligent due to institutional racism of GOP, *45 is a narcissistic sociopathic racist with a vengeance! #helpPRnow
And SADISTIC
Yes you're right, maybe some psychopathy as well. #25thAmendmentNow

Liar as well as a common criminal
Last min trip before prison Bob?
Bush never attacked those affected by Katrina, because at least Bush is human. Trump is a Demon, a human imposter
Really? you have zero credibility to criticize and even less class - you may want to start practicing on how to hold on to the soap
How come you are still talking and not hiding from shame from all your corruption and other things that I'm even ashamed of tweeting about?
How were you even allowed to leave the state you crook? Do you think any logical, thinking person believes a word you say?? #LOCKHIMUP
Says the corrupt Senator from New Jersey
1833 dead in Katrina, 16 dead in Puerto Rico.  Lives are far more valuable than property. You belong in jail. Soon.
He didn't have a left wing mayor looking for a tv camera every 15 minutes to bash him!
You are a disgusting human,Mr. Menendez with no shame

LIAR! Get facts straight. Didn't PR want US Navy out a while back?!? Now they need Navy logistics. This is "PR'S Katrina"!
I guess if u were able 2 leave the state you could go help. I think YOU have bigger worries @realDonaldTrump has Puerto Rico under control!
Why don't the DEMS show pictures of our great men and women helping in Puerto Rico, politics? Sad
- PURE LIES ! NOT TRUE ,  THEY HAVE MORE THAN THEY CAN GET DELIVERED THEY NEED TRUCK DRIVER  U  GO DOWN THERE AND HELP !
So, r u saying our military, FEMA, 1st responders, and volunteers aren't working hard enough? PR infrastructure ancient due to corruption.
You spelled bribery corruption and under age hookers wrong
Shouldn't you be in jail. Your are the last person anyone should trust.
Stop spreading swamp lies.

Was that your last vacation before incarceration?
Gosh, u would think u would b thinking abt ur own Katrina.
Words from an individual allegedly that commits Medicare fraud...
Typical DNC machine politics
Just get your stripe suit on Senator.
I really thought Bob would lay low until his perp walk.
You're going to jail, sir.  Do you know what that's like?
1800 people died in Katrina. fewer than 20 in Puerto Rico, and some of them from lack of Dem and Teamster response to tragedy.
Did you find any teenage girls in Puerto Rico? IDK how much you paid those prostitutes but it wasn't enough.
You're defending a radical Castro-loving leftist who supports convicted terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera.
Maybe 45 & his New Politburo have calculated that Puerto Rico gets no electoral votes.
Whose plane did you fly down there on?
U r just pissed off that u can't take any more bribes from the down and out..Enjoy picking up the soap
The fastest way to jumpstart Puerto Rico's long term recovery is instant statehood.   Please get the ball rolling on PR Statehood.

For those who don't let the truth get in the way of a good story here's the actual timeline of massive federal response in Puerto Rico->

You are a total embarrassment to New Jersey and to the USA. Please resign now!
Bush delayed, but not because of maliciousness. DJT is deliberately malicious and endangers human life for sheer malevolent joy of suffering
Say it Bobby!  #Prison!  You have no credibility with #America. Stop the #lies already!  #MAGA 
Have sex with any underage kids in PR? You sick pervert.
With such a lack of credibility, you should really keep your lame opinions to yourself.
. @SenatorMenendez Grumpy you don't get you're 'cut' of the loot?  er...  AID?  Or just no underage Hookers for 'ya?
Which doctor provided you with his private jet this time???Did you make a stop to DR to satisfy your pedophiliac urges???
Is it as worse as stealing 104 million from Medicare & child molestation??
Bob your just a Crook, people won't forget ! Don't you worry asshole !!
Did you take time to visit the DR??
All those under age girls waiting for you????
I heard much blame of NO residents over their predicament. Just not the President.
Crook.
Thank you senator. I hope more congress members will speak out about @realdonaldtrump's odd behavior. Please consider impeachment.
Asqueroso
And you can only blame YOURSELF  for being corrupt.
I heard President Trump is planning on making an EO giving@RealJamesWoods your seat in congress..
@GeraldoRivera has a broadcast tonight. his family STILL lives there and he has been there from day one. Just watch.
Sure Bob, you are a 'moral authority'
You're going to love prison.
And I believe everything Bob 'Bribe Me' Menendez says....
Truth comes out, can't take the spotlight off your crimes...
Lock yourself up.
PR government is corrupt. Were you there tying up loose ends? Asking for a friend Senator.
You are corrupt...so there's that.
Who would attack London mayor in midst of terror attack, San Juan mayor during disaster, Senator w/ brain cancer, and a disabled journalist?
Typical lowlife corrupted career criminal politician. Why would you even show your lying face? Prison will be good for you! Resign!
Come on, U helped create the game plan. 1. Bash Trump, 2. Lead people of PR to believe he hates. 3. Relocate PR's to FL, a swing state!
Trump's not attacking people of PR. He's done nothing but help. It's the POS mayor playing politics over people. U know the drill. #demshate
....you're not in jail yet?
at least Bush didn't steal from Medicare w/his horny buddy!  PR needs to roll up their sleeves.
You didn't take a private plane at taxpayers expense, did you ?
Do you read the news about yourself? You know what's going on right? Any criticism from you is welcomed.
The Democraps were worse than horrible and terrible. It was unbelievable! New example of disgusting! Pigs!
Why don't you use some of the millions you stole from medicaid to help?  #DrainTheSwamp
Speaking of "worse", how's your trial coming along? My guess is you stole enough to afford the best lawyers, right?
Hows that corruption/getting serviced by underage hookers trial going?

When you enjoy your first prison jenkem, you'll find a little more clarity.
Jenkem is your prize for Underage Prostitutes and Bribes.
stock up on anal lubricant at the prison commissary. Inmates may not be a as gentle with you, as you were with underage hookers.
You'll figure it out.

Did she get back some of what she is giving?  Oh the poor dear, maybe she should attend the meetings instead of doing interviews!  MAGA 
Trump attacked ONE person.  The mayor of San Juan who claimed he did nothing.  She lies.  Now so do you.
"Grow up" is a interesting choice of words for a Senator on trial accused of having sex with underage children.
Tell me again why the teamsters aren't delivering?? 
Are you ready for PRISON
Google videos showing people riding bikes and enjoying life. We both know you need to cut it out.
Does your Hypocrisy  have any fucking boundaries?
Shut up @SenatorMenendez, you're literally being investigated for hundreds of millions in fraud, you have no credibility, dumbass.
I would have to say you're the last person on this planet that I would believe #PaytoPlay #Corruption
Tell the truth,  criminal.
Hi hi ho it's off to jail you will go!
I thought you said there was no aid and that was trumos fault. Now it's something else. Got it.
Resign!
ARE U SERIOUS? Calling Trump out 4 not doing his job? U will be in prison soon for CORRUPTION.
SUFFERING? They are doing it to THEMSELVES!  Early reports say a thousand shipping containers are sitting, with no permission to distribute.
Have you ever heard of throwing stones in glass houses Mr. Menendez? By the way, how do you like your pizza? #pizzagate
Funny to see virtue signaling from someone who abuses children
Oh Bob.. we are aware of the goings on in the world. MSN no longer important. Keep yourself busy w/ how you will occupy your jail time!
Good luck at trial lol
You should probably lay low until the whole possible long prison sentence thing blows over.
Why do all these goobers keep Tweeting?

#Cop from #PuertoRico calls radio station to claim #Trump Relief Effort is being sabotaged. True? 

#MAGA  #PR #PuertoRicanLivesMatter 
Why would anyone believe anything that comes out of your criminal mouth Bob?
Did you ask the teamsters union to quit striking and get their asses into their trucks to haul cargo?
Gee how did you h to PR when you are involved in a federal trial ??????
You have no right to talk about anything you are crooked as they come and will end up in jail
He didn't blame anyone, unlike the mayor.
Don't you have a trial to attend?
YOU'RE ALL SHOW AND NO GO!  #MenendezBuffoon
Says the guy going to prison for fraud and corruption.
How was your last trip before prison?  How much did you cost the taxpayers on your field trip?
Bob, we've set aside a place for you to go over the Puerto Rico situation...
Resign Criminal.
#ImpeachTrumpAndPence
So are you going to get the snip before you hit the yard or just let the boys tattoo titties on your back?
He didn't attack those suffering, just that socialist piss ant Cruz.
Thank you for your leadership, Senator
Wait, they let you travel?!?  Was it on a private jet stocked with your favorite drinks? Who owns u now? Criminal.
You are piece of work. hurricanes are not the work of one man. the taxpayers pay your bills why don't you pay for PR.
that are  rottening and sitting on ships waiting in cargo holes...while libs and union. Play politics..disgusting!
DJT..declare Marshall Law..remove major and union workers..let Military take over....move supplies!
When the US government offers to help, you work with them. Certain people decided to work against US & @POTUS has every right to call em out
this major is just the front for the hatefilled liberals..why is union demanding new contract now?
good move Mr Felon..how long for you idiots to,hatch this attack!  Union drivers refused to move supplies
And Cholera wasn't infecting people....
Maybe we should trust Bob with the PR funding. You know, for safe keeping.
Oh my God . Please help these poor Americans .
How much have you donated to PR recovery, Menendez? Or, is all of your $$ going to attorneys to defend you?  You have nerve. #DrainTheSwamp
Since they voted let's make PR a state.
Hope you do serious jail time.
How's your corruption trial going pendejo?
Tell Bubba to take it easy on you Bob, I'm sure you can't bribe him from ramming it where the sun don't shine.
yo trump banned you from going there..... investigate Menendez!
People of PR are disposable according to dumb f&ck Dolt 45, the racist buffoon
It is time to #GetWokeOrDie
So, to become a beloved elder statesman, invade Iraq, or hand the banks trillions and a Get Out of Jail Free card. 

Good to know
I heard the Truck drivers are demanding a lot of extra money to drive, PR must also help itself
