Correct. It's unnecessary cruelty.
Government shouldn't be involved.  Those meals are not edible.  My parents couldn't eat them.
@colinhussey22 ppl use headstand as daycare and ppl abuse meals on wheels ..cut welfare to.
To be fair, no one has ever accused a Republican of being compassionate. They're a righteous group of heartless bastards.
I am beyond disgusted. There are few programs more important to our society and healthy & educated population
@margaretsfolly May I remind all Hitler took out the elderly, poor and sick. ANy human weakness he eliminated.#looksfamilar

Take from the poor and give to the rich! What about all those who lose their jobs due to these cuts?
Denying food to OAPs &cutting assistance for vulnerable schoolkids now being touted as "compassionate". What is your long-term goal here?
"compassionate conservatism" 
@DianaHollins well if you had any doubt as to the soullessness of this administration, you won't now.
@ImpactDemocracy I don't see how Mulvaney can hold his head high or look in the mirror after these comments. SHAMEFUL.
Where do they keep finding these people? #Shameful
Compassion?  They really do think they are above it all, no room for these demons in the white house.
@TDaceyM This IS the GOPs idea of compassion. Wait until they ramp up the military and  forces ! #DontheCon #ToxicDon
any #ICE #police #prolife #military #veterans who won't oppose#TrumpRussia budget betrays vets elderly
@puppymnkey If this is his idea of compassionate I'd hate to see what his cold-hearted hatred looks like!
demons is what these fools are just straight evil demons.
sad!
HELP!!!! Are they sick? Never seen worse.
I remember when meals on wheels started. How much is it costing the nation and who is benefiting the elderly or the program
@BonnieGranny Those programs are supposed to be funded by the states not federal programs! If cut its the states fault
@puppymnkey Well them old folks and little tot's parents shudda taught them self reliance.
Okay... Let me get this straight... Big Bird and Thomas the Engine are out. And more guns are in. Education and food are also out, for guns?
this guy is just sick and no twisted logic will make him better
What's next Social Security, Medicare
Thank you, Senator. This was a lesson in cognitive dissonance and Orwellian doublespeak.
@RaniaKhalek Private money is more than capable of picking up the slack. Especially if prosperity increases.
Dems need to play this clip in every "Rust Belt" county Trump won!
What? One of the most compassionate things we can do? Are these people serious?
If you can't afford basic social programs, you can't afford that shiny F-35.

@ImpactDemocracy the more we see WH press pool, the more stone faced they look.  No longer are they shocked by press conf
Somehow I doubt this is about animal rights.
The GOP has its own special dictionary
there are many ways to meet these needs without taxpayer dollars.  Term Limits and congress on samehealthcare
@puppymnkey I'm tired of testy republicans on tv
the propaganda is so transparent; they do not mean "compassion", they do not mean "mercy", #unAmerican
@ImpactDemocracy Yes compassionate..People don't need to worry about eating so this relieves that stress. #TrumpCares
@RaniaKhalek u realize CA has record poverty and homelessness and an inadequate supply of psyche beds, right? Just FYI.
@ImpactDemocracy This is exactly who the GOP are. Cruel, hateful & self serving working for their $ donors. No surprise
What is wrong with that idiot??? Compassion???
@BonnieGranny : #fakenews
It's hard to beat Stephen Miller's sadistic, stone cold eyed Nazi dialogue but he managed to do that today.
@morgfair I say we fund "Tar and Feathers".
They really should!
.@SenKamalaHarris @RaniaKhalek Especially as he bloats out the military budget even more. #draintheswamp #resist
Their communications are straight out of Nazi mind control. Seems they announce incredulous dogma, and repeat.
@puppymnkey why ar we spending money for the military ,seems they're having a grand old time splurging in parties,
@puppymnkey It's thoughtless and cruel! Besides regression never makes anything better!
you dont even understand how the programs are funded. who made you senator
Good tweet Kamala!
Oh, no! Yes, it is! It's compassion because the millionaires don't want to pay taxes and they are sad. Feel pity!
Never cut the meal from the table.@realDonaldTrump
@LeslieMarshall Like everything since Inauguration Day 2017, it's no surprise new cuts hit seniors. @Potus @GOP must go!
compassionate? Are you kidding me?!
This is down right cruel and mean spirited.
how da fuq is it compassionate. USA for the sake of your people, get this administration out.
We dont mind our taxes going for these programs . We like taking care of our elderly. These ppl are NUTS! #Trumprussia Sic!
my daughter will be 27 in April. 1 of the smartest. education started w/Head Start. I'm grateful. shame to cut
We are on track to become a third world by the time this administration is done with destroying the USA. #RESISTTRUMP
Why does he want the billions of dollars for private prisons? Who does he plan on putting in them?
@IvankaTrump the work that you're pursuing is being directly undercut by your father. Why hurt American families? @SenKamalaHarris @MSNBC
@MimiLeroch they are cutting Head Start! OMGOODNESS no
@MimiLeroch It's class warfare.
terrible. We can't let this happen. Impeach
This world is not going to survive with these heartless monsters in office. Cruel
Cruel is right. Slashing free school lunch 4 poor is cruel.dare them 2 concentrate on work while starving
How long does it take to get that bastard out of office. He never should have been there in the first damn place
@LeslieMarshall "America first" my a$$
yes, he is, they are. Makes me so angry.
@ResistBLOTUS These people are seriously sick, if they think what they're doing is in any way compassionate.
If cutting #MealsOnWheels is "one of the most compassionate things you can do" please do NOTHING ever again.
It's just insane that he could even utter that bullsh*t with a straight face. This whole admin is morally bankrupt
@Bangelnuts Those bitches know no compassion.
Monsters! Heartless monsters!!
What have the @GOP become? They not only lost their mojo but they drowned their humanity along the way to this circus!SHAME
I watched this live and wondered where'd his humanity go. "Compassionate thing to do?" I am utterly speechless
@realDonaldTrump and the rest of the Russian-loving scrooges are DISGUSTING. Looking forward to 2018.
These programs do so much good, I've volunteered with both they literally are life saving and life changing
How could anyone be so heartless to cut Meals on Wheels for elderly? Simply inhumane.
The federal government doesn't have to fund every organization.
fake accts like yours
@cwindt99 ~ Compassionate? Karma will be a hard one for him!!
@bingwisdom Trump has no problem screwing his base. Bet they're feeling real smart right about now.
they'll be fine. They can take time to enjoy a holiday on the water
@nyawkino @jaketapper R TAX $s NEED 2 go 2wards helping r nations POOR, VULNERABLE, ELDERLY & CHILDREN!NOT BILLIONAIRE DT!
NOT MY TAX $s to Build a WALL! NOT MY TAX $s to SUPPORT 45 at Mar-a-Lago & his 3rd. Mrs. in NYC!
One of the most compassionate things THEY can do. Humans are capable of much more compassion, but this administration...
How long before Breitsparks et al report that Meals on Wheels is a front for a socialist terror cell?
SERIOUSLY
There is no compassion when it comes to taking things away from the most vulnerable, this is some really #FuckedUpShit
@Smith83K 
The Elite telling the Citizens to eat cake.
@ILoveMySteelers what utter bs. I can't even. Malnutrition in children sets a lifetime (shortened) of health problems
@americanmclass This is 1984 doublespeak compassionate = sociopathic
@americanmclass It is cruel.
They're cutting Head Start? Head Start got me addicted to reading and paved my way to Duke as 1st gen. college grad then Harvard. 
Thank heavens the president is working to eliminate such addictions! I hope you're still fighting those urges.
Problem is most Trumpanzees aren't addicted to reading, education or thinking
The only ones seeing any compassion are the wealthy - those poor things pay WAY too much in taxes.
"Compassion" brought to you by the Administration that produces #AlternativeFacts.
@SenKamalaHarris
Cutting Meals on Wheels & Head Start is not "compassion." #PressBriefing 
Mick Mulvaney should prob brush up on the definition of COMPASSION. @MerriamWebster can help: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compassion …
@SenKamalaHarris
Do not let this cruel budget pass!
These assholes are defunding what they never had or will have to experience. That's not for the people.
Christmas with this guy must be a hoot!
It is the opposite of compassion.
@JumpTheRework 
Meals on Wheels
Is part of who we are
As Americans
Help the poor
It's in our DNA
there was once upon a time in America where family took care of family. Not.meals on wheels
Kamala, the great !!
@maddow
- food not bullets & helicopters & boats
@Smith83K WTF???
@AnthonyAsaro1 #Heartless #ThankYouKamalaHarris #FreeUS
#NullifyVote #Revote #NewElection
Your idea of compassion isn't compassion either. 20T in debt. Middle class done tightening their belts. Govt needs trimming
@Smith83K just one more in the long, ever growing line of assholes running our country
Be compassionate to the 1%--DOUBLE their taxes
Did I miss where mulvaney & dt are thought to be compassionate?  More like power & money grabbers!
Well sure. Trump can't make any money on social programs like meals on wheels, PBS, the arts, medicare, ....

@PhoenxLord it's definitely not Christian or Christ-like.
I don't think this guy knows the definition of compassionate.
I'm pretty sure he's also morally bankrupt.
Don't think many would disagree.
Hellooo George Orwell!
@skennison trump minions too stupid to remember wheel always turn. They can hope there will be real compassion then
let the elderly and young and helpless starve . It's for the greater good @GOP  pull your Cheeto loving head out from below
@realDonaldTrump  Trump budget heavy on war low on supportive care of Americans
Alpha males are utterly unfit to be Servant Leaders. 
So sad that Americans thought Money could buy them love. 
#Impeach45
please Cutting WASTEFUL spending is NOT cutting programs! This rhetoric helps no one. If u want to help then help!
you can start by building a better program!Or By establishing non profit orgs to take over these programs. Lots can be done
meals on wheels  our elderly need it so they can eat
Gullible left fooled by media lies once again! Pay attention!
they could care less of being compassionate
My Dad told me #welloff ppl in his senior living community drive to sites for free(or donation) meals.  He was appalled!
What about the #notwelloff people who will die? Is that appalling?
It's horrible! The people Trump said he would protect, are the most screwed. I knew that this was going to happen.
The people that got coned need to wake up b/C they are going to be hurt the most.
They don't get it yet. Maybe they hear any news ever!?
Euthanasia has also been referred to as a compassionate ending of a life.
old people don't need food kids don't need school
@skennison  name of the game is: tax increase. Fed tx nt go down but states' will to offset loss. Poor states hit hardest
this will make secession easier & a serious option: less reliance on Fed money.Good for Hi,Ca,Tx & oth. But best for Putin 2
why do these people think needy people are like an an Animal that needs to be put down....such comapssion
@RossHilleary WTF is wrong with this WH. I think they want to keep ppl poor and hungry and believing their lies.  #Resist
@ukexpat19 @SenKamalaHarris @RossHilleary Yes. Believers of lies. Until death do us part.
Compassionate conservatism indeed. I bet DJT doesn't even know what these programs are. #resist #ResistTrump #Budget2017 #UniteBlue
@ukexpat19 @SenKamalaHarris Go back to Russia. Meals on wheels depends on the federal $ to run. Period.

@resistthis2017 it's criminal
@SimmonsGmarlins It's also opposite of "Christian" which is what all these Republicans & Tea Ppl loudy & frequently shout
AMEN!  Not reflective of the Christian values I was raised with. Pseudochristians.
Your'e a senator and you don' t know that Meals on Wheels is not a federal program?  Another example of your ignorance.
Cutting Meals on Wheels, Head Start & PBS is WHAT TRUMP VOTERS WANT. GOP MUST OWN THESE CUTS, WALL, MARALAGO WASTES, & ALL TRUMP EVIL.
Head start is a scam.
HeadStart is a LIFE SAVER!
From tough love to tough neglect to tough hatred.
I dont think Mr.Mulvaney knows what "compassionate" means. 
#FakeNews Federal gov't only funds 3.3% https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/03/16/liberals-stop-saying-that-trump-will-kill-meals-on-wheels/amp/ …
And how many local,state&fed directors of MOW have you spoken with?Its a BIG DEAL + you're heartless
@skennison compassion version despicable fasciste
ANY budget cuts will generate considerable moaning. Many will have to be weened from the government's handouts....they will do just fine.
Jesus is turning in his grave!
I understand your sentiment but GOOD NEWS!  Jesus isn't dead. He's alive. He's probably VERY upset w GOP.
OMG R they doing drugs? They HAVE to be doing this purposefully..maybe distraction? These GOP people are inbred terrorists
talking about #wheels, why does this fish have better health coverage than most Americans?
These are state programs. They should fund them. We can do better locally. The Feds are out of spare change.
Well are we surprised?
The ability these people have to rationalize their ideas is truly mind boggling and scary.
Very scary.
@IndivisibleEB it's programs like these that benefit society! Are they trying to kill us all?
Yes.
@RepJayapal Act of Malice. Period. Own it. You are cruel and craven
Some more of that "Compassionate Conservatism"? #ImpeachTrump get rest of his cockroaches out of there, too. I'm looking at u2 Jared Ivanka
@ukexpat19 @SenKamalaHarris That would b ideal. But will it ever happen? He is getting away with everything.
it is hateful
How is cutting their program "compassionate"?
@RepJayapal Sad thing is, I doubt Trump has ever used that word.
Up is down and down is up with this administration. 
@GrasshopperHF Cutting Meals on Wheels is cruelty.
how did we ever live without it. Why don't you take care of Grandma?
Can we have him define "compassion" because I think he thinks it's a homonym for "cruelty."
If this is the budget they actually try to pass or anything close to it...SHUT IT DOWN!
Absolutely! Torches and pitchforks!
GOP working to separate "makers" from "takers". Just deciding who goes first: elderly, ill or children.  Disgusting.
I think they're confused about who are the "takers," and "makers."
Democrats think money grows on trees, so there is no spending that is not "compassionate".
Have you seen how these greedy bastards live!? How much more than the workers earn will ever be enough?
People on Meals on Wheels have paid taxes their entire life. MOW helps them.be self sufficient and age at home .Saves tax $
@ukexpat19 @SenKamalaHarris Trump Russia Bannon Nazi warfare Americans, separating Makers vs Takers-old,poor,sick,disabled,young
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec

"AUSTERITY for EVERYONE!

(Except the ultra-rich, defense contractors, CEOs, and Wall Street.)
Budget dir. doesn't get to use the word compassionate at all.
You brain dead liberal...meals on wheels is a state decision.
Not exactly. While the primary funding is through states, MOW receives federal funding through block grants.
it amounts to about 3% of their entire budget.
#PRESIDENTBULLY
Unbelievable, he said "it was one of the most compassionate thing we could do" without blinking an eye. #TheResistance
Unless by compassion you mean cruelty.
These people have no heart.
You mean something that's barely funded by the feds?
It'll be fine from here on out- most of it's charitably funded anywys.
Their compassion logic is akin to taking the family dog to the rainbow bridge because he cant walk as well as he used to.
Indefensible, not compassionate and awful
