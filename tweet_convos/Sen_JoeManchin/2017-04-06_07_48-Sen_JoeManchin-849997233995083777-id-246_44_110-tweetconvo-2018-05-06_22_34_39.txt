We are disappointed that most Dems are voting politics not qualifications.
No President, while under FBI investigation, should be able to push through a Supreme Court pick.   That vote should wait until after.
Would you be saying the same if Hillary were POTUS?  Doubtful. BTW Trump himself is not under investigation. Facts...
Say hello to Justice Gorsuch.
I'm deeply disappointed that you &  @SenatorHeitkamp &  @SenDonnelly voted with Republicans to confirm Gorsuch.
You're a disappointment to your state Joe...I'm looking forward to voting for an actual Democrat when your up for reelection
#primaryManchin
I am deeply disappointed that you voted to confirm Gorsuch today.
When you voted for Gorsuch you endorsed the GOPs theft of that SCOTUS seat, I will donate to anyone that runs against you, your the problem
#RESISTANCE is deeply disappointed you chose to CYA instead of stand united. Nothing will save you now. NO $$ FOR REELECT! @TheDemocrats
Thank you for helping to prove my point that the Democrats and Republicans holding high office are nearly identical when it counts.
Seriously @Sen_JoeManchin Sen Byrd rolling over in his grave You're a Republican Straight up You've robbed the Unions who gave you your job
Seems like you are getting what you and the GOP wanted? U can't play both sides Senator. We all know how you planned to vote.
Were U disappointed when HR did it in 2013.Why didn't our fore fathers feel the need for the filibuster?The Democrats should  n the mirror
Thank you for voting for Justice Neil Gorsuch.
Voters will remember how you voted.
You made it possible, DINO. Hope this is your last term as a traitor to your party and freedom for Americans
@Sen_JoeManchin stop it! No more BS. You're clearly a Republican. You only run as a Democrat for political clout. Well played you traitor.
Not surprising you support @gorsuchfacts , a bigot & corporate tool, since you worship Byrd, a bigot & corporate tool.
Those of us who voted for a democrat who would stand up to a judge like Gorsuch will be voting&supporting another candidate next election
#senatorManchinforpresident
It is simply another step in the politicization of the judiciary. Voting for Gorsuch has not helped rectify this in the slightest.
Thank you for doing the right thing. Wish more of your colleagues had your common sense and represented the will of their constituents
TRAITOR to the democrat party
Nobody can claim that Manchin is a leader fighting for civil liberties and worker rights. Maybe in a Bizarro world.
I am deeply disappointed that, later today, many Senators plan to vote for the #NuclearOption 
Maybe you should of  been outrage at them stealing the seat.
I suppose, Manchin, you went out to dinner with Gorsuch and your Republican friends.  Get used to having lots of time on your hands.
And why did you vote for Judge Gorsuch? His record is obviously deeply flawed.
I'm looking forward to sending a check to your next primary opponent.
Me too!
I am as disappointed as you are now, when @TheDemocrats invoked the #NuclearOption  to pass Obama care.  All of you need to mellow out .
Folks in WVa should be very proud of your service and thoughtful positions representing WVa and all citizens of the USA. Best wishes. FL
You betrayed the American people by voting for Gorsuch. "Party aside" he is not good for our country. Even SCOTUS didn't want him.
Thanks for voting for a very qualified jurist, just like some Republicans voted for Kagan and Sotomayor. Obstructionism harms all Americans.
Really? You voted for Gorsuch!! Why are you disappointed? You betrayed us!
so why did you vote yes ?!?!?
You did not have to vote for Gorsuch, but you did! I salute your courage! I hope more dems can be bipartisan.
Gorsuch does not share our values. You're like a fox in a chicken coop. You are not of our party. Get out and be with your own kind.
You don't get to vote yes for Gorsuch and then turn around and feign contempt for this. I hope the voters remember this.
Pathetic sold out. You will not be reelected, regardless.
Hey, why did you vote for #Gorsuch then? You seem to go against the @SenateDems every time! Big Money playmates have you?
Yet you voted for #gorsuch. Huh, weird how that works.
So disappointed you voted with the enemy to confirm him. Go caucus with your new party traitor.
But not so disappointed that you won't join the simple majority of Republicans that did this? You & Ivanka need a dictionary: Complicit
And I am deeply disappointed you went with the Republicans to vote for Gorsuch knowing he's a hard righter and not even near a Moderate.
Thank you Senator for voting for Judge Gorsuch. I wish more of your colleagues would have also done the right thing.   #MAGA
Do Dems a favor, leave the party of your own volition. You and that daughter of yours set a bad example.
We are deeply disappointed you voted to confirm Gorsuch.  #Resist
You so disappoint me
Yet you voted to seat a corporate authoritarian to the bench for life. I'll be donating to your next primary opponent.
Joe, thanks 4 acknowledging ur support for Gorsuch. Now we r letting u know, we will do everything in our power to make this ur last term.
Get rid of Joe Manchin  for supporting Gorsuch. We see your loyalty is with the republicans...
Maybe many senators shouldn't go for filibustering a Supreme Court nominee for the first time ever!
So change your vote!! #NoNuclearOption
Republicans change the rules to benefit only their political party; not the American people.
No you dont Republican.   You are going to be primary.  We saw what you did yesterday.  Get out of our party loser
How can you sleep being in Soros Party? WV deserves better, libs ALWAYS make fun of your great state.
It will help destroy congress, but Dems left no choice as they try and stop everything our pres does.
Thank you for your vote
well, you shouldt have sold ur vote !!! how much was ur price .... u have no morals and hope u are voted out and will with that !!
Those 45 senators have no interest in doing what is right for America. Sen. Manchin may suffer for his vote, but he's no coward.
It never did rise to the level that the threat was imminent to the U.S of A,” said Manchin,who drafted an alternative Syria plan with Russia
Then you should have gotten more Senators on board Joe
Well, you could have joined your fellow Democrats and pledged to vote no on Gorsuch.  Many Senators = all Republicans.  Just say it.
I'm deeply disappointed that Democrats are being so unreasonable. You can thank Harry for making this option possible to pack lower courts.
The Reid Option...
I'm surprised you aren't voting for it yourself.
So disappointed that you've turned Republican.  You know you'll need to switch parties before reelection?
Nation knows exactly who did it; going to make a lot of democrats harder to get re-elected...now it is the known as "Reid-Schumer Option"
I'm disappointed that you back Gorsuch. You knew this would happen and now you will try the other side of the fence.
The Filibuster has been overused, misused, and abused -  it's value as a political parliamentary tool has long expired
Senator Manchin, you are the only adult in the room.
This is more than disappointing!  This is another step in GOP's attempt to take over our democracy.  They must be stopped!
Put party politics aside? You put your party aside a long time ago.
Disappointed and did what? Time to remember that you're a Democrat!!
Would you expect anything less from McConnell?  He needs to retire before the entire country is ruined.
Get your head out of your ass and stand with the Democratic Party or change your party affiliation. Straddling a fence just breaks it down.
What R U doing abt it? The Rep's have been doing things that R harmful to the PPL since Jan & NO 1 is doing ANYTHING abt it! Needs 2 STOP!!!
How can u be disappointed?  You turned coat and voted for Gorsuch. You are one of the repubs.
..the right thing. Period. R.S., Al
... Stand tall, Senator, and "We the People " will stand with you. Al, GySgt, USMC, (Ret) . You & 2 others KNOW you did ..
..of W.Virginia spoke LOUDLY on 8Nov. I believe you still have their support. Don't waste it w/ political statements. ...
Senator : Please don't walk this back now. You and 2 other Dems have done a good thing for "We the People ". The people ..
Why wouldn'tthey the rest of your party isn't interested in makingAmerica great only their petty Obama agenda
I cannot wait until we send you back home for good.  DINO
Sort of how many of us feel about a number of your votes. 2018 can't come soon enough.
Switch parties. Stop wasting our time. We will come back in 2018 and you will be on the wrong side of history.
You small, weak, insignificant person. You are a sheep. Although many sheep are far nobler than you
YOU HYPOCRITE!!!!! This hypocrisy is OVERWHELMING. How can you tweet this and then put your head down and get in line?! History is watching!
It's NOT a nuclear option; it's returning senate to rules bastardized by Dems in 2003. Present your facts straight.
Once again, Dems cry foul when their own creation is used against them. Seemed like a great idea with BHO in office & HRC on deck didn't it?
And I know you opposed it. I'm speaking of Dems at large.
- we are very disappointed that you plan to vote for Gorsuch !!!
Please vote NO on Gorsuch
Everybody knows who's to blame. Stop standing up for the obstructionist in the Senate. Start calling them out!
You've been bought off by Chem plants & Coal Co owners in WV. Ditto daughter & her Epipen. @sen_JoeManchin #Resist #Resistance Primary him.
PPFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTT. C'mon Joe. It's too late for that
Constituents are getting disappointed over all the whining going on. Stop the political bullshit and start getting along w/each other.
Why didn't you convince more Dems to do the right thing and vote for closure?
Because Judge Garland never got a hearing.
How bout preserving SCOTUS?Sen Byrd rolled when Reid broke the ice & he rolled again.Gorsuch dsrvs seat-blame Schumer n Dems
Thank you @Sen_JoeManchin  your willingness to collaborate is appreciated deeply.    We can only pray DemLeft will follow your leadership.
I am deeply disappointed your party cannot acknowledge a fine judicial candidate. Garland;s block a reaction to Scalia's SUSPICIOUS death
Joe: PLEASE help take back our DemParty from FarLeft - they are full of hate and anger - they are pushing for Civil War...
It's either Nuclear Option or none.  Those Democrats are idiots.  They more than likely won't get re-elected to office.
Don't like what the party you cozy up to does?
Me too but  Democrat haters  forced Republicans to go that way.
Donald Trump is under investigation, #Gorsuch is comprised.
Every Democrat, liberal, including Obama should be  in jail. Obama did enough damage.
Cause that'll fix it. Obama isn't president any more.
Trump Flunkie
Then tell your cronie Dems to VOTE Gorsuch into Supreme Court. Remember Wv voted Trump, best watch what you do yourself
Cronie Dems?   At least they had the decency to vote for the other parties nominee.
YOU don't know what your talking about
#NoNuclearOptionVote Stand w your constituents! #NoGorsuch He votes against workers & children! #WorstRatedPresInUSHistory
>hates that the GOP used republicans used Nuclear Option
>still decides to vote Gorsuch in anyways
Get fucked in 2018.
Though I am against Gorsuch, I do agree with you on your other points.  The fact that government no longer represents the people is a sin.
And we are disappointed that democrats are refusing to vote for someone that is clearly qualified for the job.
Wonder where they learned that?
THEN VOTE NO on a plagiarizing nominee made by a POTUS under investigation for TREASON
Do you plan on voting for SCOTUS still?
Unbelievable, you and the other turncoat Dem Senators caused this problem
Why are YOU VOTING Yes for GORSUCH?  He votes for corporate interests like Trump.  Focus on good renewable energy JOBS for yr people!
sad day for democracy
But you voted yes to Trump's Supreme Court nominee.
Thank you.  Good to see someone in Congress who puts country first and is not a hypocritical partisian clown.
The disappointment is in you, Senator, for voting "yes". You should cry together with the other hypocrite @SenJohnMcCain & the other 2 Dems
Why are u disappointed? YOU were voting for him. U should be elated on your pseudo Dem cloud 9
Spare us your hypocrisy, please.

#GOPLite #GOPFail #SCOTUS #NuclearOption
Then do something, Joe. Washington has become the laughing stock of the world. Please help get that clown out of there & end this circus!!
Boy @Sen_JoeManchin, then it wouldve been nice if maybe you'd at least shown solidarity with the party by joining #FilibusterGorsuch.
Oh please! You're part of the problem by voting in favor of his nomination.  Wrong side of history @Sen_JoeManchin
That can turn into a fatal mistake
Harry Reid and @SenSchumer destroyed the Senate first, period!!!
Given the #GOP plan to pull that trigger, will you stand with the American people and your constituents against #Gorsuch?
Thank you for not supporting the "nuclear option" . No party is in power forever, this is bad for everyone, for the future #NoNuclearOption
Time to stand up for the constitution, Russian investigation first!
Support the filibuster and show us how much you care with you vote, not empty words. Forked tongue.
Why, you are a republican now.
I wish you were the senator for us here in NJ.
Thank you. You're voting on par with what we, your constituents want, instead of being a partisan hack under Soros thumb.
What else do you do? Entire Democratic Party are obstructionist and readily admit it
Were you saying that a year ago when the GOP were refusing to even vote on Obama's pick?
sad indeed. Even those who say it is wrong are voting to do it. Shame on them.
If your party would set politics aside they wouldn't have to
You Sen. Traitor should as well
And how will you vote, Joe?
And why did you vote with the Repubs in the re-vote just moments ago?
What a joke!  You cannot keep fooling WV.
Disappointing that majority of Dems are acting like spoiled children. Confirm Gorsuch.
I'm sad that your liberal colleagues are being such obstructionist over a rule that was set by Sen Biden. God help us.
Actually, it was Harry Reid who wouldn't bring a Bill before the Senate. The Rep House passed plenty.
More #GOPShitshow
Why? Democrats voted for Nuclear option on all other Judicial appointees under Obama.
Well thank the Democrats who filibustered a judge who would follow the constitution. He's not liberal enough for them.
Leave the Democrat party....get the balls and do it...
Lead your party and call out Dem partisanship abt Gorsuch. Voters see clearly what Dems are doing. Why cant u get us 5 or 6 more votes?
Your disappointment is misplaced. The partisan politics to enact 
 first filibuster of SCOTUS nominee is the issue. Vote for the Reid Rule!
stop the filibuster.
You are a traitor to the Dems. You have sold your soul to Trump and you may get re elected in WVA but you are a loser to the USA @BCGProd
It's a damn shame that the Dems can't vote for a decent and worthy candidate.  I hope the GOP stacks the deck for decades.
STOP BLAMING Republicans for problems Dems like Reid creates in the Senate. Repubs approved Obama's SCOTUS nominees, Dems think the rules
You can REFUSE to vote for Gorsuch under such conditions!! You know that, right?!
Maybe you shouldn't support this nominee!!
we dont want to see it either but #dems are playing politics and dont want a SCOTUS who follows the law
You can thank fellow Democrat Harry Reid for that, you can also thank Reid for never passing a budget, much less bills.
And I'm disappointed that I have to breathe the same air as you.
Then you should build consensus amongst your fellows to confirm a clearly qualified candidate for Supreme Court Justice. #confirmgorsuch
We do not want to see the Nuclear Option used to confirm Gorsuch but the partisan politics will force the process. Sad reality but necessary
Tell me Mr Manchin that the Democrats would not do the same thing if it was reversed.    I know (they would not dare ) lol
One of the few Democrats who aren't selfish.too bad @SenateDems @SenSchumer have no vision of past or future.        @RichardGrenell
What?U have already given him ur vote.U can't pretend outrage now.We've seen ur true colors. #selloutsenator
Justified in this scenario!
