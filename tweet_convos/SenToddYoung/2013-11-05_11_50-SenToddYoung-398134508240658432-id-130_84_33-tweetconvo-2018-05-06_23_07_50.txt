@SpeakerBoehner I am flipping out. You all let me down. I cannot stand any of you. How could you let him get away with this?
@SpeakerBoehner @RepToddYoung So what are you doing to make it better other than complaining and trying a full repeal for the 300th time?
@SpeakerBoehner No, Johnny. We needed you to DEFUND it.
@FoxNewsMom @SpeakerBoehner Defunding was never really an option, as the funding was MANDATORY.  Don't let Faux News kid you on that one.
@legaleagle48 LOL. Faux News, the ONLY network who warned of OCare disaster. Good one. Oh, and this:  http://www.redstate.com/rs_insider/2013/09/22/how-john-boehner-and-mitch-mcconnell-are-funding-obamacare/ … @speakerboehner
@FoxNewsMom You're missing my point.  The ACA COULDN'T have been defunded even if Congress had wanted to because funding wasn't optional.
@SpeakerBoehner, SCOTUS ruled SocSec unconstitutional when tried 2pass as insurance; so passed as tax. File Injunction w/ CPA! ht/ Graewoulf
@SpeakerBoehner I don;t disagree, but guy, put on your big boy pants and focus on repairing it instead of repealing it...which wont happen
@SpeakerBoehner Well you should have stuck up for @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee & had some balls!  U R another one to #leadfrombehind #idiot
@SpeakerBoehner I'll believe you believe in #fairnessforall when you and your Tea Party cronies #PassENDA .
@SpeakerBoehner  Help if you will. I am speechless. I have no hope anymore. I truly mean that. I'm out. I can't fight alone.
@SpeakerBoehner  He priced like a life insurance policy.... Are you kidding me? What a joke this is!!!!!
@SpeakerBoehner @jonmartin44 We NEED #REPEALOBAMACARENOW It's so bad 4 Americans on every level! Only winners R B0 & cronies. Are U a crony?
@SpeakerBoehner immigration reform will have the opposite effects mentioned here... Call it to the floor...!
@SpeakerBoehner You mean the premiums from the fake individual market that re-thug invest in & now trying to pass a law to maintain.
@SpeakerBoehner Mr.speaker I support you completely.
@SpeakerBoehner LOL you really are an exaggerator. Only policies being dropped are junk policies that are expensive & cover nothing!
@SpeakerBoehner Where is the whole truth - this ain't it.
@SpeakerBoehner how is that Ted Cruz working for you now he cost you ,how about getting something done on Gun control you useless bunch!!!
@SpeakerBoehner Compromise isn't a dirty word; when your Id,Ego,and Superego refuse to compromise the results is psychosis,aka OBD. "THINK!"
@SpeakerBoehner people are finally starting to look deeper into the ACA and understand that it's a big piece of unconstitutional crap!
@SpeakerBoehner when are you retiring?
@SpeakerBoehner including how do they cover children of parents that are on Medicare Medicaid VA till 26 dah!
@SpeakerBoehner Fairness is now shot so let's repeal OBCare now.
@SpeakerBoehner 
Can we fix the IRS (flat tax) while we're at it?
@SpeakerBoehner I don't think any of you really know how hard it is to go in this economy. To push and squeeze every nickel and now this????
@SpeakerBoehner  I will be paying more for my healthcare per month than I will my mortgage... This is an outrage.
@SpeakerBoehner  I don't know what the Supreme Court did here, but its no fix.  Defund Obamacare now. No one can afford these rates.
@SpeakerBoehner  You need to fix this. Otherwise all Americans over the age of 40. Stop working go on welfare on January 1st.
@SpeakerBoehner  Only with a life insurance policy the premium is yearly.Obama wants us to pay this monthly. Has he lost his mind?
@SpeakerBoehner  How could all of you in the Senate let this happen?. I just got my new healthcare deduction today at work.
@SpeakerBoehner  He lied to me and all of the American people. Now I should stop working, and go on welfare then it will be free. Done!!!!
@SpeakerBoehner  what did they do with all my money that I have to pay extra money now again to be covered. Are you joking me. Impeach him!
@SpeakerBoehner Obamacare discriminates against people over 40. We paid our dues, I had healthcare my whole life and luckily never used it
@SpeakerBoehner I'm sorry you feel that way. But It is the LAW.
@SpeakerBoehner And just who voted the Law in???
@SpeakerBoehner You as a leader should be able to get votes to make it better and you will get the credit for it. Aren't into getting credit
@SpeakerBoehner Said it B4:McCain=Genius."Take Air force 1, go 2 Silicon Valley & load it w/all the geniuses that work there & Fix It!"
@SpeakerBoehner better plans, shared costs, responsibility to get insured, oh yeah it's here and it's gonna stay and we ain't going back!!!
@SpeakerBoehner should encourage states to expand Medicaid programs so individuals have a great chance of find affordable health coverage!
@SpeakerBoehner We need a Speaker of the House that has the balls to fight to repeal that law, not a Coward like you.
@SpeakerBoehner no more cuts to SNAP! try living on the subsidy for a week- people need to know when their next meal is to work
@SpeakerBoehner Every day, it's what WON'T work, or what CAN'T work. You offer no solutions, and no plan. #obamacare
@SpeakerBoehner Fairness for all! Exactly!
@SpeakerBoehner absolutely. Remove HHS Regs. Let States set Minimum Coverage. Cover Per-exist. Under Fed Ins program buy in. Keep old- plans
@SpeakerBoehner we need to vote you out of office

@SpeakerBoehner Then why didn't you stand your ground?
What is Republican fix? @SpeakerBoehner With premiums rising & policies disappearing under #ObamaCare, we need #fairnessforall Americans
@SpeakerBoehner Obama is destroying this country. Is there NOTHING you can do? He has lied to this country and keeps lying.
@SpeakerBoehner / And we need it QUICKLY!
@SpeakerBoehner  Fairness?? Since when are your fair?  Half of all working people made less than 27K and you want to talk fair.
@SpeakerBoehner Can't you tell Obama he's a Damn Lier
@SpeakerBoehner if you had any stones you would B standing w/ Sen. Cruz  and Lee in front of a mic on NBC screaming at the top of your lungs
@SpeakerBoehner I bet you spend on 1 bottle of booze what an average family in the snap program spends on  a week's worth of meals.
@SpeakerBoehner hey asshole why don't you talk about the bills you are preventing from coming to the floor. Such a coward
@SpeakerBoehner see I don't sense your urgency when Congress grandfathered themselves or better yet exempted themselves from the law
@SpeakerBoehner Yet  another halfhearted swipe wheres your big press conference where is your presence in the media?
@SpeakerBoehner start with your resignation and entry into rehab. OH!, what about fairness for hungry kids??
@SpeakerBoehner This is for ppl  > Good news: 17 million people  eligible for premium tax credits in the new health insurance marketplace.
@SpeakerBoehner What #Americans expect is for you to quit crying and lying about the #ACA and focus on #jobs like you promised. #gopfail

@SpeakerBoehner  cc  Obama denies health care comments...  Video recordings show him saying them -- at least 29 times!
@SpeakerBoehner EXCLUSIVE: DEMOCRAT BUNDLER PUSHED LIBERTARIAN INTO VIRGINIA GOV RACE...  how could GOP let this happen?
@SpeakerBoehner fair treatment isn't the same as equal treatment
@SpeakerBoehner Why is everyone letting the SCOTUS off the hook on Obamacare. They re-wrote the bill that's why it's the law!!
@SpeakerBoehner aaaaaaand the tantrum continues....
@SpeakerBoehner you're a waste of time; do something positive and quit crying wolf
@SpeakerBoehner Are you listening/reading?  Get over it, stop the lies.  DO the job you were "hired" to do, work for a reasonable budget!
@SpeakerBoehner Fact is: AHA is a great idea & will be a great legacy for the POTUS which is why you are focused on destroying it. HATIN~
@SpeakerBoehner Of all things you could address you attack AHA because you KNOW the legendary impact it will have.
@SpeakerBoehner I am starting to worry about myself. I find I am agreeing with you more & more.
@SpeakerBoehner You and people that run your twitter feeds are clueless.
@SpeakerBoehner There Is NO Fairness 
When It Comes To The GOP & We Won't Forget The Obstruction Come 2014. GOP Party Of The Rich!!
@SpeakerBoehner Yes, make sure Fairness Doctrine" is not part of it!
@SpeakerBoehner Why do you continue to do this

@SpeakerBoehner @4chunat1 So why did you cave? None of you guys can be trusted. the Natl. R Party is a cesspool.
@SpeakerBoehner There's no such thing as "fairness for all" in Gov. You sound like a Dem/Liberal-Replace the mandate & defund corrupt Law.

@SpeakerBoehner JOHN YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON TO SAY ANYTHING,YOU SHUT DOWN OUR GOVERNMENT,YOU ARE A TERRORIST WITH THE REST OF YOUR CRONIES!
@SpeakerBoehner Then why did the house and senate pass it in 2010. ENDA is more of a problem. Acceptance and love are family values.
