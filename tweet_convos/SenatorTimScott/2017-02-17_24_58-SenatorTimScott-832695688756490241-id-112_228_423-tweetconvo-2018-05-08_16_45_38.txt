such short notice looks like u planned 2take vacation instead of DOING UR JOB. Vte him out 2018, do 3 twnhalls
not paid protesters. Investigate 45 and Russian ties. Demand he release taxes. Stand up to a tyrant!
hope you realize paid leftist protesters will be there....telling you they are Republicans
I'm lifelong SCGOP voter & I'll be expressing concern over @POTUS attacking judiciary & media
it seems like you may have it all wrong....there are the ones attacking him!
Nope.  It's definitely @POTUS on offense.  Saw & heard it.  He sounded unhinged. Cra cra
I get it after checking some your tweets your a closet leftist....aka racist! Sad for u!
Racist?  That's a new one. Trump cultists never stop with their #AlternativeFacts 
just a friendly reminder Kasich got crushed in the election. 8 years of Trump. Thank god
8 people care about your thoughts.  I'm not one of them. #BlessYourHeart
explain this at your town hall
GEE. A whole 17 HOURS NOTICE! After 14k Petition signatures! HOW THOUGHTFUL @maddow @WatchYourRepsSC #sctweets
Good Luck. Obama's OFA might show up to shout, do your job. Have security for Polite Disruptors ready.
These are trained professional Protesters from Obama Foundation. Reference his Website. Formidable group. Real
when should we expect you to have a town hall in the Upstate? Why less than 24 hours notice on this one?
thank you for holding the town hall. I know voters are going to be happy to speak with you.
Thanks a lot for the advance notice. Maybe you should hold your own town hall not piggyback on Sanfords
will it be televised, or streamed? Would love to watch.
This mightwell b ur last Sen. term 4 u until u realize u wk 4 th ppl n not urself. Townhalls@all 3 locations
you are a joke i think you need to start looking for a new job soon.
Please allow Dems go if you can.  And don't disrupt the meeting but make sure you ask questions.
I'm a concerned GOP voter.  Thank you for scheduling.  Lots of trepidation about @POTUS & 1st Amendment issues
Representatives are a farce they get elected to manage their own way not to listen to the people, so wrong.
- thanks for the notice! 1day? cmon - DO BETTER
Why wait until the last minute to announce this, @SenatorTimScott ? @MarkSanford gave us more advance notice!
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Way to give your constituents some notice & hold town hall in convenient place for them. #cowardly
Remembering the 'White Rose' movement today in history 1943.
it sounds a little rushed and poorly organized to avoid @TaraBurnette a #taxpayer @LindseyGrahamSC #Shade
way to give plenty of notice and make it hard to attend. Crowd control....
Hi @SenatorTimScott. I'm a voter worried about losingACA coverage. I have a disability that limits travel. Short notice =poor accessibility
.@SenatorTimScott Were you planning to host a town hall in the future? How did you guys decide to sync up and join forces? See you tomorrow!
We had to get 14k signatures on a petition to get him to agree @MaryCaitlinByrd @RepSanfordSC usuallyprefers paidGOP events
Could you share the petition with me? Link? Or email cbyrd@postandcourier.com
It's been a huge PITA Groups have repeatedly gone to their offices thru-out state: Cola, Chas, G'ville.
We are outside.. Can't get in
Sen. Scott, you are showing a hell of a lot of courage scheduling a townhall 18 hours ahead of time. #truegrit
Why is your time more important than your constituents? How about a little heads up when planning a town hall
Hope you are not ambushed by Dems. Teacher unions are ticked about DoE DeVos! Ensure security is good.
.@SenatorTimScott Waiting until the end of the day before a 9:00 am event on a Saturday?  That doesn't seem like the run around AT ALL
Aww what is wrong libturd, not enough time to get the buses filled and make it from NYC??
Love you too, @veritasingod
Tim Scott when are you going to hold town hall for upper part of state??? #ignored
Watch out for the paid protesters.  I hope your REAL constituents are heard. Best wishes
@IndivisibleTeam saving this to remind your constituents in 2018
what a sh*tty move to announce a 9am townhall the night before the event. Spread this! @IndivisibleTeam
@PARISDENNARD @MarkSanford Good luck Tim. I wish you well. Do not let anyone blame you for current situation.
@PARISDENNARD @MarkSanford after a teacher finally got him to do it. He announced it tonight giving people NO NOTICE.
I'm waiting for one in easley. Can someone ask if he considers the media "enemies of the people"?
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Are you all of a sudden realizing you may not get reelected?
this SC teacher/mom #TaraBurnette has more grit. Don't be afraid to listen to voters
@JoshSchwerin @MarkSanford Mark Sanford the political dead?
@RachelMaddow                    Tara Burnette is great.  She needs to run for public office.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Less than 24 hours notice?  Nice try
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford shame on you
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Last minute meeting to inconvenience the peasants he has no respect for.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford a flip about them or their concerns! You have proved it by this FARCE disguised as a Town Hall
You guys must think you're pretty slick? Nope. @SenatorTimScott @MarkSanford @maddow, #RESISTANCE, @womensmarch, @IndivisibleTeam, #ACA
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford hope you get hammered tomorrow
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford would these people vote for you again? They shouldn't you have no respect for them and can't give
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford How could you do this to people who have REAL concerns and voted you in to give them a voice? Why
Little Scottie, you never cease to amaze me with the foolishness. Why such short notice? Please do/be better!
You're a disgrace to civil rights heroes in this country. Please be quiet.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford names you were called a few weeks ago reading emails on the senate floor who is your acting coach?
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford you have a whole week off. You should schedule more than 1 town hall.
. @SenatorTimScott . @MarkSanford  Geez Louise. Thanks for a little advance notice. You know how to suppress attendance was well as voting.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Hope consideration given to multiple locations to accommodate citizens/voters in your state.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford u piggyback someone else's Town Hall hours away for your constituents You were in tears about the
gutless TOM
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford u should be ashamed T.Scott you refused to see your constituents until u were shamed and then
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford   Have your own Town Hall you chicken. Have near one of your offices. CHICKEN
How far from Clemson? Kind of a jerk move to announce a last minute town hall 3 hrs away.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Great to see you have finally agreed to meet. Your constituents have  been asking for a month.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Thanks for the advance notice!
Tim Scott's hypocrisy made the national news...What a coward...
Laughable, the @GOP  just doesn't give a fuck at all.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford let those idiots know that you will NOT vote for them ever again!!
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Good idea.. don't ya think a little more notice would be in order. I guess not
Not even a 24h notice... That's plain hateful and ridiculous.
Coward! Only 10 hour notice for town hall. You're a bad guy.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Waiting for @DebFischerNE @SenSasse
a town hall with less than 24 hours notice....clearly you don't want to meet with your constituents. Coward.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford And he'll be available at the Charotte Airport Starbucks for the next two minutes.
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford u have the nerve to announce it tonite for a 9:00 am townhall tomorrow am with graham, chicken
it was announced 5 hours ago! Go back and watch Maddow!
@GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan R's avail during elections.Ignoring Constituents
So glad you two have been found safe and sound!

@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford Wow such short notice? Shame on you!
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford congratulations on making it happen! 
@MaddowBlog @MarkSanford HA

Tim be careful and don't let the haters stop you!You will be in my thoughts and prayers as you speak the truth
watch out for the fake dem plants their causing a ruckus in a lot of conservative districts#faketeaparty
fake post
wish it was Mount Pleasant, MI!
Good luck! Hope it goes well and the crazy protesters don't ruin the townhall for your voters.
Sorry I can't be there to shout YOU LIE to you Trump devotees.  Joe Wilson set the example.  YOU LIE YOU LIE
that kind of like Shame Shame Shame
thanks for the update
Nice to see some teamwork.
laughable
real politicians would go places to try to earn votes.  Leave your comfort zone Tim and come talk to us.
Is Jim DeMint coming too?  I would have appreciated adequate notice of the meeting.
trying to cut out the soccer-parent contingent?  :)
Oh great. Another chance for you to NOT listen to us. Pruitt is bad for our coastline and much more.
elections have consequences. You didn't win?!
I hope the "professional protesters " don't close you down so you can actually have dialogue.
...said the clown with the egg icon and who is obviously a "professional" himself. Get a clue.
says a man with a picture of the sky 
be prepared w/ stats & facts on Obamacare unlike other GOP reps who've hosted town halls recently & failed.
you know the moon bats will be there with their fake outrage
@indivisible_sc Pass this along.
Urgent #Indivisible! @SenatorTimScott is joining @MarkSanford in town hall on Mt Pleasant TOMORROW 9 AM Show up!!!
.@MarkSanford & I will host a town hall meeting tomorrow in Mt.Pleasant at 9AM. Details in graphic & on website – http://scott.senate.gov  
@scdp @SCProNet @AikenCountyDems @YDofSC @RichlandCoDems @GvilleYoungDems @RockHillRising
Thank you.  I hope you can comment on your views regarding an investigation of the Russia/Trump ties.
there are no ties but thanks for showing your ignorance!
At least Mark isn't sold out. Sanford  is fully redeemed.
Sen Scott i urge you to be careful the Soros and OFA paid agitators will be there
I can get paid to go just because I'm against Donald and the Republican Party line zombie supporters?
lol ! More like you want to continue to support failing policies
What failing policies do you think I support? I'm amazed that so many Rs can read minds. Incredible.
Brad, they are the poorly educated... Trumps quote
Good…but be ready for the union & lib activists to overrun. Hope that your loyal constituents show up.
Scott hasn't been listening.
If you think that …you haven’t been paying attention.
