thank you Senator Bennet.  
Are you holding a town hall this recess week in Colorado?
I guess I'm curious to why people cannot review the numbers (and graphs and charts) that show climate change is happening because of us.
Then again if you show @realDonaldTrump a graph of #globalwarming he would most likely reply, "#China" #justsayin
@RepJeniArndt @EPA thank you for being our sane rep.
thank you for all you do--writing the truth and building community.
so glad you're there for usn
THANK YOU for your efforts re: climate change.  PLEASE FILIBUSTER Gorsuch for the Supreme Court to help save our country!!
Thank you, Senator, for representing your constituents and state so well!
Thank you for representing us with integrity and consciousness
Thank you! @SenBennetCO @EPA
Thank you Senator Bennet!
@AltEPA_ Thank you Sen Michael Bennet for standing up for us Coloradan who want to protect our state against polluters.
thank you Senator!
@PeakDems You surely haven't forgotten the @SenBennetCO is a tool of Oil & Gas man Phillip Anschutz and his conglomerates that include ...
... The Gazette, The Broadmoor, AEG, Lakers, Staples Center, Major League Soccer. Regal Cinemas @SenBennetCO's work. @PeakDems @SenBennetCO
... and you'll find @SenBennetCO Regal Cinema merger not only cost jobs and competition but landed in Federal Anti-Trust Court. @PeakDems
.@SenBennetCO @EPA Climate change is fake, as you know
Voted no on Scott Pruitt's nomination for @EPA because we can't afford to ignore the science on climate change. #ActOnClimate 
Thank you, Senator.  Your commitment to Colorado is noticed and appreciated
& @SenCoryGardner should work together 1 day for the good of all Coloradans.  It seems your just cancelling each other out.
Thank you Senator!You are appreciated
Thank you! Pretty soon those republican senators won't have ski vacations in #Colorado! #Sad #ClimateHope
thank you!  Clearly @SenCoryGardner doesn't realize how important the environment is to people of CO. Shameful!
THANK YOU SIR

Thank you! Still got in, but at least you stuck by science
wrong again mike!
You have my vote of confidence
ethanol thank you Sen Bennet keep up the good work
Thank you! Now if only @SenCoryGardner could follow your lead instead of voting party lines. 80202 #corygardner
Thanks Senator Bennet. Colorado thanks you for standing up to extremists.
thank you for doing what's right. I'm glad to know Colorado has one senator to be proud of (looking at you @SenCoryGardner).
seems you will take any reason to vote against Trump.
thanks! Science doesn't care what we think, science is!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/832656463805956096 … (Ranked 1st for Feb 17.)
You lose again with your partisan hack games.
Thank you.
the climate data was adjusted to fit the need for control. Climate changes always for many reasons. Man a small effect.
thank you for your help!
Obviously we can. Thanks for trying
Thank you!
Stay strong Senator, we appreciate it in Durango
thank you Senator. Also, can't afford to put people in charge of agencies they fundamentally oppose
Thank you so much for trying. Going to be a tough 4 years. But we will persist (was going to say persevere, but...)
thank you!
Thank you for once again standing up for what's right. Sickened by the new lows the @GOP has managed to achieve. #Resist
As one of your constituents, thank you for standing up today in voting against Mr Priutt. #nopruitt
Thank you, @SenBennetCO. Too bad we couldn't stop yet another outrageous nomination and confirmation. 
Thank you Senator Bennet, for all you do for the state of Colorado and for your constituents.
thank you.
what science? Slot of that is pure lies
way to go Senator Bennett.  Thank you!
Thank you! Again you reflect the values of your Coloradan constituents!
Thank you Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you, senator! You did the right thing. And as a constituent, I'm proud you represent our state.
TY for standing up for the health of Earth & its people. We're lucky to have someone who cares abt this unlike @SenCoryGardner.
Thank You! Unfortunately @SenCoryGardner does not listen to his constituents and voted yes.  Sad!
Thank You! Unfortunately @SenCoryGardner does not listen to his constituents and voted yes.  Sad!
Thank you so much!
The basis of the lawsuits wasn't about science. It was about federalism. SCOTUS seemed to agree. Stayed Clean Power Plan
Thank you Senator Bennet
Your arguments are right on.  Thank you...keep standing.  Keep speaking.  You have Colorado's interests in your heart.
Except there is no such science. Other than that small fact ...
thank you senator Bennet! Keep fighting for what is right
Thank you for your vote and looking out for your constituents. You are on the right side of history, sir.  Keep fighting!
thank you Sen Bennet- your vote and support are appreciated!
Thank you again its great to have a level headed view in Washington.
Thank you for all you do, Senator Bennet!
thanks for trying...maybe someday the rest of the Seante will clue in to reality/ethics.
Thank you Sen Bennett for saying No. To bad the Republicans don't care about our children's future!
Thank you for your dedication to protecting our environment, now, for our children and beyond.
Thank you for fighting for us and our environment! @EPA
thank you, Senator. Clean air, water, & my own job in Colorado depend on EPA funding and regulation promulgation.
too bad @SenCoryGardner didn't listen to his CO constituents! Thank you for listening unlike the so-called senator
thank you for actually speaking for your constituents!
thank you!

Boring and so predictable.
THANK YOU! Colorado knows we can count on you. @SenCoryGardner needs to STOP serving his party & serve his STATE!

That's why we call you The Good One.  Thank you again for standing up for what is right.
Thank You Senator for standing with Coloradans! Clean air & water are basic human rights for all humans. 
Thank you!
I'm horrified that he's been confirmed. This is devastating. Thank you for trying and keep up the good fight
of all the abominable cabinet choices this is the one that dooms the planet! #StopPruitt #TheResistance #DumpTrump
Maybe have this talk with your fellow Colorado Senator @SenCoryGardner? Seriously.
Thank you!
Don't give up.  The pendulum will swing the other way.  We won't forget your efforts.
thank you, Senator. History & future generations will remember  who stood for (and against) what's right. Many see it now
Of course you did. Working for @SenSchumer not CO. What should be @EPA focus? #GoldKing or  #climatechange #obstruction
thank you. RIP common sense.
Thank you again, Michael!
Thank you for doing what @SenCoryGardner is not. Shame on you @SenCoryGardner. Answer your phone/email/tweet - ANYTHING!!!

Thank you for your support and protecting Colorado! We need clean air and water.
Thank you, Senator. You are our *real* representative - as opposed to MIA @SenCoryGardner.
Thank you for your efforts!
Thank you for being pro-clean air and pro-clean water for all Americans.
Thank you for your effort!
thank you
At least of our of Colorado senators cares about what's important for CO. Not @SenCoryGardner;we don't know what he thinks
Cory is saying all of our tweets are paid for.   Not really us
  Thank you Senator Bennet!
Thank you! Even though it didn't help. Sigh.

You liberal crybabies lost. Get the hell out of the way. You are my senator Mike, I live in CO. Stop standing in the way, NOW!
thank you sir for understanding what's important! We know you tried!
TY Senator but this makes my heart hurt once again.  WHY are they doing this to our country?  Please explain!
thank you for voting to protect our environmental protections.
The debate is about, "MAN MADE" climate change. 

PLEASE quit this fake news false narrative, Bennet.
@ @EPA Tennessee might see things differently.  Colorado wants a strong @epa. Thanks, SenBennetCO
thank you. This will be remembered come election time. You hear that, @SenCoryGardner, you crooked fuck?
This is going to be a long and discouraging fight until enough principled R's find some guts. Please cont. to fight for CO
thank you for voting against him! We'll remember!
Thank you for voting no on Pruitt
Thank you for your efforts. This is devastating news for the environment of our state which is a major part of our economy
Thank you Senator. Unfortunately your colleague @SenCoryGardner once again ignored his constituents’ concerns.
I will NEVER vote for Cory again.   I will remember.
I will, too. Started saving any change I can collect to go towards fighting @SenCoryGardner reelection.
Thank you, Senator. If only @SenCoryGardner cared as much about the environment as the Coloradoans he "represents"...
Thank you for voting no.  Will you commit to fighting back against any envir unfriendly action he takes?
Thank you.
Thank you Senator Bennet.  Can you please try and talk some sense into @SenCoryGardner
