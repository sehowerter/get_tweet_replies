National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials, officials say http://wapo.st/2kPv1qE 
These disturbing reports & Russian efforts to influence our election pose a threat to our democracy–we must respond
@NYhatesTrump @YouTube @SecretaryCastro @JoaquinCastrotx release taxes, 45 doesn't stand for America , he has personal agenda
Yes we do, Senator. Sooner rather than later. @LeChatNoire4
.@SenatorDurbin @puppymnkey 

They are not "possible" links. They are real. Fairly well documented even.
@washingtonpost 
Yup, you can't trust Sessions!
@susanbr42259458 An independent commission is the only viable way to investigate this mess!
@SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue Too bad my GA senators will pick party (and self-preservation) over country and do nothing.
so do something or get the people that can to do something. Stop tweeting and DO SOMETHING
@washingtonpost join @BillPascrell in requesting taxes thru Congress. Please & thank you! American's deserves some answers.
Please give us an indication of how this can move forward. It's imperative to save our democracy.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton @repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenWarren @CoryBooker Our democracy is in great peril!
Very disturbed by the silence of your Republican colleagues on this and other nat'l security problems.
This is certainly a matter of National Security and importance which the POTUS would love to sideline with nonsensical fluff.
#Blah! blah! blah! #Hate! Hate! Hate! Blah! Blah! #BORING!! #saysomethingnew #givingdopesavoice #obstructionists #losers
Do you realize how stupid we look to the world? Reading twitter is eye-opening and newspapers across the world! Laughable!
You are going to need the best because the gop nazis have had a lot of time to cover the tracks
Obama was the President! Civilian undermined the current administration! Flynn should and will be done!
Senator. I've watched you over the years. Even when I was Republican. Thank you for your hard work & great leadership!
Pure Democratic Party nonsense trying to rationalize Hillary's humiliating defeat. Flynn was incoming official in new admin.
We urgently need answers.  Read the transcript from the @maddow show of 1/26.
@kasthomas @washingtonpost how about we investigate obama giving iran our tax dollars first?
MAKE IT HAPPEN
yes we do!! Thank you
We need an independent commission to look into the Traitor-in-Chief. @SenatorDurbin #TheResistance #resist #ImpeachTrump
Please follow @Khanoisseur because he has compiled a ton of info on Trump/Russia ties. Please see his twitter line!
Thank you @SenatorDurbin we must respond.
this is all a lie.
You owe Flynn and this administration an apology.
Demand investigation.  We are with you
We need another #holdthefloor until the @GOP sets up an independent commission to look into PeePeeGate. @SenatorDurbin @sheltielove
@washingtonpost  So what is the plan here? Can you go to high court to demand investigation? And get taxes in discovery?
.@PattyArquette @SenatorDurbin @washingtonpost There is a Writ of Mandamus on the docket of the supreme court asking to nullify the election
Nice... All the more reason to make sure we keep right wing ideologues off bench.
that or #PresidentBannon does.
or most likely both do.
Collusion was verified yesterday
YES,YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT
#trumps taxes will tell the tale
@24bearcoughlan Chaffetz where are you, lol...I guess Hillary is the only one you want to investigate.
And do not forget the halted investigations on the Clinton's body count and Obama's illegal weapons deals and Seth Rich......
#DworkinReport #Trumprussia #TrumpLeaks
please and thank you
Dems need to wake the hell up and get moving. Enough talk.
Must do everything in your power to investigate Russia-Trump & Trumps  debt. #divestdonald #Putinspuppet #realDonaldTrump
@JW4Hillary #TheResistance Indeed they are sir...please advance the full weight of America to prove such intolerable actions
@intenseCA yes! #InvestigateTrump #FollowTheMoney #PutinsPuppets This election was compromised!
Thank you
IT'S ABOUT TIME! Round them all up in the middle of night and have them testify asap so we can add perjury charges 2 the list
agreed.
# please save our office of the potus. This is not funny anymore. Man do I miss Obama. : /  READ NOAM CHOMSKY PEOPLE
I still strongly believe that their marriage is a wreck and that they are trying to hide their son's disability.
@Planelyfun #imwithcomradetrump
@SenateGOP @SenStabenow NO INVESTIGATION? NEVER TRUST @POTUS, @GOP OR @SPEAKERRYAN AGAIN! E-V-E-R.
Don't forget @GOP, who exploited "Wikileaks" disinformation down the ballot.
The methods and means need to be fully exposed.
@KathyStricker2   Do it Already. Independent special prosecutor is the only way to go.  R u looking at potentials??
what are our representatives doing? Con man Trump & his claque have broken so many rules & laws & we aren't even 30 days in.
what does it take for our Government to wake up?  If this was Obama they would be all over him??
@washingtonpost Let's get that independent commission to investigate Trump! What will it take?!?
.@SenatorDurbin @noodlelover17 We, the people, agree! #Flynngazi #PutinsPuppet
Els/ Rybolovlev look alike/chosen to golf with Trump while R in town, MSM trapped in basement, all photos on course >50 yards
And somebody from a neutral country to handle it Too much corruption in @GOP @CIA @FBI #russiagate
@msrachelwolf Better late than never.
Then get moving..the people  are waiting.
unfortunately, GOP has control of both chambers. McConnell & Ryan would refuse to investigate. Dems must win seats in 2018.
@conjja it's about time! Have you guys been comatose the past few months? Enough is enough! Get to work
BUT THAT JUDICIAL RULED A CORPORATION IS EQUAL TO A HUMAN BEING WHICH IS WRONG ON ITS FACE AND BLASPHEMOUS AT ITS HEART.
@RACZPATT well what are you waiting for?
Thank you, Senator, we do!
@265961fc22994f5 totally agree
Thank you for speaking out Senator.
Wow. You think so?
YES
Sam Irvin and Howard Baker aren't around anymore, so someone has to step up
ok, you're a Senator, DO SOMETHING PLEASE!
yes Senator we absolutely do need it and now.  Do not let it be swept under the rug
you damn fools better be glad Russia didn't take Obamas bait WE COULD BE IN A COLD WAR if not-HACKED VOTE #FAKENEWS geez
.@SenatorDurbin Yeah, so what's the hold-up?  Let's go already!
@New_Colossus_ so why hasn't this happened? It's February, been over 3 months since the election & the gov't has let us down.
Lead the way!  Go down in the history books!  Tens of millions are behind you.
@bettynjackson @jasoninthehouse @SpeakerRyan can we quit worrying about the unborn for a minute and look into this !! REALLY
Please push an investigation. We deserve to know. #Putinspuppet #TrumpIllegit
Twitter talk is cheap Senator, get on those Sunday morning shows and make some noise. Step up, do it.
Lead Senator lead,push hard like our democracy demands, for all the people.
I agree am investigation is warranted, & it must be independent & not dependent on any Republican oversight.
love this. Please keep up the pressure on 45*.
- sir, please read @Khanoisseur for lots of threads detailing what you just tweeted
@OversightDems @senatedems you are going to get heavy deflection/resistance from within & without. We cannot let this go
@kasthomas @washingtonpost. Turban Durbin said our troops abused Muslims. He lied! Scum!!!
Disgrace to Chicago and US!
@kasthomas you have lost your mind. STop trying to bully our @realDonaldTrump.He's a good man.
@washingtonpost
yes. Keep posting !
Absolutely, but must truly be independent. Don't trust Repubs investigating themselves.
@SarahRIles @Nirvana @MsLaurynHill #letlizspeak #homedecor @FoosanerMuseum ART SALE AT http://KIRSCHPORTRAIT.COM 
you need to get a special prosecutor on this now!
GET TO WORK SON
Get Bill and Hillary to investigate. They know their way around dealing with Russia. Uranium deals & $ 750,000 speaking fees
talks cheap , lets do something NOW!!
go Mr. Durbin. Someone must stand up for the rule of law in this country. The GOP has turned it's back.
This is treason if this is true and the appropriate action needs to be taken reminds me of watergate
Just impeach and imprison him. Using the presidency for personal profit is criminal.
Senator I am your constituent.  You all should have been focusing on this impeachable offense for WEEKS! now. Please do it!
please make this happen.
#AMJoy @JoyAnnReid
@SenatorDurbin @Catballou 
Michael Flynn must be investigated but the primary #RussianAgent in USA govt: @realDonaldTrump
Yes!! For the sake of our freedom!
Please do!  There are so many conflicts of interest among Trump & his Cab noms alone that it is a moral & national imperative
Yes! Make it so!
calling and writing R Senators everyday. What else?
we need to impeach and suspended all Trump admin take action stop tweeting and get impeachment or be voted out ,only option
With the smoke coming from 2016 there's a hell of a fire and it's not going to be hard to find but it'll be tough to put out.
Yes, we do!!  Keep fighting.  #resist
", as well as leaked #PodestaEmails, #ElectionFraud, #PayToPlay & role of Foreign Govt Money in @HillaryClinton Campaign." ~ @SenatorDurbin
they were always there senator
Thank you, Senator, for defending the Constitution and protecting democracy.
@drsa_five CONGRESS YOU WERE ELECTED TO SERVE CITIZENS AND NATION NOT THIS CONMAN DO SOMETHING STAND UP FOR OUR NATION 
HOW did 45 not know about this Friday!  Joke
All this is very good and well. But, why can't our politicians be proactive rather than reactive to what was a known element?
@washingtonpost this isn't already happening? @FBI @MaxineWaters @CIA @ODNIgov? When we gonna stop saying & start doing!!?
@grumpy2481 Make it so
Yes your Voters from Illinois agree with you along with the majority in our country-this is bipartisan issue of nat security!
yes!!  Please act!!
The reasons we're already enough without any additional information! Help #saveourdemocracy
Well let's get it done.What can the voters do? This is ridiculous.We are losing our democracy. Please help! #saveourdemocracy
with all do Repect Sen "We the Ppl" need an independent commission to investigate just about EVERYONE in @POTUS org INSANITY
100% we can't even trust the FBI
So is a commission going to be convened? And what about Flynn? Violation of the Logan Act is a felony. @SenSherrodBrown
MT "independent investigation #LoganAct '#Russia if you'R listening' code" no time America needs Trump impeachment trail ASAP
no shit, Senator. No offense intended :-)
Let's see some legislation to back up that talk. Thank you @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP = cowards.
Don't just sit there tweeting, DO SOMETING!
Make it happen! Hope you bring this up on senate floor also#
@rosierifka @washingtonpost #sentaor it appears in front of us that top rep Ryan Mitch chavettz all had sense of scandal ?
Focus needs to stay on Trump/Russia/Flynn. All else a diversion
YES we do!!! I'll be calling your office to say the same. Thank you!
Yes we do!
Yes we do Senator & House Dems have bill ready to impanel. Trump presidency result of #RussianHacking
There's no precedent, process for a new election until 2020, right? But if outcome is illegitimate, we shouldn't have to wait
If Flynn colluded with Russia (you help us win election, we'll help you...?) & Trump, Pence knew, what happens next?
get it done. Talk is cheap
What is the FBI doing?
we need independent investigation of the president and his team to understand illegal influences & payments. US=rule of law
do your job DD.
we are counting on you and the rest of the Dem senators to take care of us. INVESTIGATE and IMPEACH!
100% agree.
Yes we do. Will you push for it? #IndependentCommision #RussiaHack #ThisIsNotNormal
Yes, the stink has become unbearable...
@washingtonpost Please keep pushing for this to be investigated!
@washingtonpost How will you go about producing this commission, Senator?
what steps are needed now to get this investigated?  Can the president/congress stop  this?
Yes!! 
finally!
Well if you can make that happen you will be remembered as an American Hero in the history books.
Yes, please do something!  This election was STOLEN  with orchestrated effort between Trump team and Russia.  Illegitimate!
@sissel9lw @washingtonpost What did/does McConnel know?  Every person involved should do jail time or worse.
@sissel9lw @washingtonpost What connections do Manafort, Bannon, Flynn, Marttis, and Tillerson share?
Guess you haven't found @SkeddyRuxypin yet? Got It all charted! @SpottlessMarxx https://twitter.com/SkeddyRuxypin/status/830222305393405952 … @SenatorDurbin @sissel9lw
h/t to @Ne0venator who saw a copy/paste error in this chart. Stephen Miller was incorrectly labeled "businessman" instead of "operative". 
@sissel9lw @washingtonpost Where did calls with Flynn take place?  Where was Pence?  Did Ryan know?
@sissel9lw @washingtonpost If Putin wanted Trump 2 keep eye on Russian Jews & Russian oligarchy, what role did Kushner  play?
..True Justice would Be 2 have the Woman who Actually Won the Presidency placed back in the Oval Office -where She Belongs#!!
@donailin Be more vocal and persistent on this Senator.  Our future is at stake. #StayLoud #StayVigilant
@washingtonpost How about nullify election due to GOP TREASON and have new election like other democracies do?
@sissel9lw @washingtonpost Thank you!  There are too many connections to Russian with most of his appointees.
@Khanoisseur Thank you @SenatorDurbin. PLEASE ensure this happens. Our entire nation is in peril.
@washingtonpost  once it is made clear that Russia interfered w/election Trump should resign & special election held.
you mean the reports y'all got BEFORE the election? Bout time! Hillary told y'all at the debate.
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Sir. We have a right to know the truth.
YES! Thank you!
@lynncullen hey come on it's not like it's Benghazi or a private server (which was never hacked btw)
@washingtonpost bet there was impropriety.
@washingtonpost 
and every Republican will lend you a deaf ear and a blind eye, and their mouths will refer you to SpiceConwy
Then do it. What are you waiting for? Show some cojones and quit wringing your hands. @TheDemocrats
ABSOLUTELY @SenatorDurbin
The reasons are piling up – we need an independent commission to investigate possible 2016 links between the Trump org & Russian government https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/830099273408712704 …
@sm_doug How can I help?
Yes, please.
DO IT!!!  WE WANT TO AND WELCOME THIS INVESTIGATION
