No. many of us are citizens concerned by slide into authoritarianism. You should be too.
I'm not a "nasty socialist puppet" and I'm very against this regime. Take it for what it's worth.
were you against the last regime? Or do you prefer marxism?
"do you still beat your wife?"
amature, negative argument.Learn some critical thinking skills.Marxism is obviously your ideology.
Do you believe that fascist or Marxist are the only two places on the continuum?
Thank you for the prestine handling of questions with Wallace,however we DO NEED investigation into wiretapping
it is a word, just used a e instead of a I...just a simple typo..fool..
and the trump fuckery continues.. how do u get elected my god
By a majority vote. It's pretty elementary
The topic was about Cotton not Trump
love correcting mistakes,but fail,Hillary Lost...Trump is your President. Calif does not determine the President 
What the Hell kind of sentence is that.."you've all be had over......" .
The nerve to correct anyone.
Lmao
Trump is an embarrassment to our country, unhinged, and is compromised. SHAME! Impeach now! @FoxNewsSunday
Impeach NOW! @clb4yeswecan @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday
SENATOR I DO CARE IF A SITTING PRESIDENT ACCUSES HIS PREDECESOR OF DOING SOMETHING ILEGAL WITHOUT EVIDENCE
If @SenateGOP thinks people don't care if @POTUS makes accusations w/o evidence, you are mistaken. #GOP_Fail
THIS is what Americans want: Trump investigated for Russia ties w/Special Prosecutor. http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/trump-approval-rating-russia-poll/index.html …
the wiretap story wasn't a "media report" @POTUS @realDonaldTrump tweeted this fake news #ImpeachTrump #fake
Your job isn't to get in TV.  Go back to work and confirm cabinet members get Obamacare replaced.
all the cabinet members he nominated have been confirmed, you can check Sen Rubio's tweet from a few days ago.
wrong buttercup
Thanks for embarrassing Arkansas again! Btw, I'm an Arkansan and I care that Trump accused Obama w/o evidence!
I care that Trump is tweeting baseless accusations about our former president. You don't? That is ashamed.
Americans DO CARE that Tr**mp is an uncontrollable child who blurts out lie after lie. Shape up!
of course you are because real journalists would want to know why trump is calling breibert news
And does the President get real intelligence briefings anymore?@icreated3 @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday
only from breibert.
Sessions: "Senator Franken ... and I didn't have - did not have  communications with the Russians, ..."
I care that trump repeatedly makes unfounded accusations.
IMO most Americans DO care about trump's crazed tweets, unfounded allegations, Russian connections.
And taxes.
'd it! Brightened my cloudy drive home! Loved your answers, especially Obama made it easier for Russians.:-)
it's refreshing to hear the truth..!!
I record on my DVR https://twitter.com/foxandfriends  daily, & take notes, daily excellent guests & great info!
#TYfor your Honesty in all matters..!! You have given me a new faith in or Administration & republican senate
We have a man in the White House who spreads dangerous lies. When a disaster hits - which Trump may cause - no one will believe Trump.
I wish you were my State's Senator instead of CT  hacks @ChrisMurphyCT& @DickBlumenthal THANK YOU for TRUTH 
why are you not doing something to get rid of the nut in the WH. Does there ha e to be a tragedy first?
the nut left Jan 20th about 12:00
Thankyou Tom, give no quarter. Run them to exaustion, advance, take ground. Fully support Trump.
Don't rule out black bag wiretap of Trump as in Watergate.
you lied through your teeth "no, I have seen no evidence" "i cant discuss what is in the file" #liar #coward
It is PAST TIME after 45 Days to get @realDonaldTrump to #PIVOT To acting PRESIDENTIAL! *45 seems UNHINGED #CP5
You have supported this loon, you will be held accountable, tax returns & Independent Committee, NOW!
Defending DT:  a career killer.
MOST Americans voted for someone other than Trump. YOU have a Constitutional obligation to investigate REGARDLESS. Do your job
Are u waiting for real disaster that we can't recover from to happen before u put country ahead of party agenda
When is your party going to finally put country first & save us from the madness of Trump.When is enough enough
Enjoyed ur interview You were respectful toward our Pres You didn't rip @GOP or members of apart Thank You
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain & others make condescending remarks about OUR Pres it pulls @GOP down! STOP!
When Politicians  ( @LindseyGrahamSC ) laugh at, make fun of OUR Pres It's disrespect for Trump voters & @GOP
watched ur interview Nded to tell you 1000s of Amers feel we get more info about OUR Country bcuz Pres twitter
I only watched because you were on, #chriswallace is a shill for the #left, you did an excellent job, #MAGA
Wake up!
I did. Pretty low of you to try to paint Obama as a Russian agent. You will drown in your own spin if you're not careful, Senator!







unhinged, unstable, unqualified, Unquestionably mentally unstable, UNEDUCATED, UNFIT, UNSTABLE, uninformed un!!

Fight the Democrats tricks to delegitamize the President. We don't need a Special Prosecutor. We need to investigate wiretaps
yes. We care. When our President is going off the rails, it matters. We care.
Reply to @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday I watched the show and when Chris mentioned Sen Coons and what he said, you looked a little shook.
The "media" who set off Trump's latest bullshit are specifically Breitbart and Mark Levin. Get it right!
You are one of the smoothest talking Republicans I have seen to date.  Start working for America though.
Thank you, Senator Cotton for clarifying what a pro-Russian administration would look like.  Obama sold us out
Great job today.  Thanks for adding clarity.
Should denounce any allegations against @POTUS44  @POTUS comments are SAD & show possible mental health issues.
Senator, hope you're a praying man..you're in a maelstrom
Great interview! Love ur composure  @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday
Senator Cotton, please support our President. Investigations need to be happening.
I watched and you seemed to want to cover for Trump. Trump wrote his own tweet but not his speech!
Watching this on replay. When are you and your colleagues going to take a stand on this unstable and unfit @POTUS?
the American people want to know about the wire taps. Quit lying.
It is your job to serve people and protect our constitution. Your interview is troubling.
#soldhissoultotrump
#JustDoTheRightThing
#ObamaKnew
#TheyAllKnew
#I'dBetHillaryKnewTOO
can you please ask DT to implement VETERAN BENEFIT IMPROVEMENTS. We are dying out here. HELP US!
U understand Arkansans can be concerned about health care AND DJT insane allegations. #DoYourJob
I did&you stunk!You do realizeDTdidn't write his speech but wrote tweets?You've reduced yourself2a joke.
it  is your duty to the US to do what you can if Trump is crazy.  He may not be, but if he is you have to do what is righ.
masterful rhetoric Sen. Cotton, "...if you want to know what a pro-Russia policy would look like..."
Shouldn't you and the Senate Intel Committee tune in to Russia investigation?
wish we had more Senators like Mr Cotton.
I care about 45s false tweets, lies.  Remember 65 m. voted for HRC, 7 m for others = 72 m & 45s 63 m.  72 > 63
Oh yea forgot can't handle 2 tough of questions. Must be marshmallows like our LIAR-in-CHIEF little hands prez
U going 2 talk about UR act of TREASON several yrs ago. "Aid & comfort" 2 Iran, by telling them NOT 2 trust USA
Trump's talked the same bad policy in a less confrontational voice. Your town hall "keep ACA"! NO "access" b.s.
I was very upset you were unable to talk about policy I look forward to hear, I certainly hope you get a chance
Thank You for stating the truth and nothing but the truth..
Nicely done!! You really screwed Trump over when u confirmed Russia transcripts exist (by refusing to discuss)!
If you can't read, watch video news reports. #ArrestObama #StandUpForOurConstitutionalRepublic #ObamaGate
I care deeply, sir. You do not speak for me.
no can't stand to see a hypocrite that you are. You are gay or bi and lots of people know it.
put DEMOCRACY before the GOP Drain the Republican swamp
asked to comment on the @realDonaldTrump tweet your prevarication and attempt to cover Trumps Arse was a joke
Yeah, Trump said we faked World War II but I haven't looked at the evidence yet. So maybe.....

SO idiotic.
your lack of understanding of the enormity of @realDonaldTrump tweet attacking Obama and democracy is shamefull
Sounds like people at your town hall LIKE ACA! They want TAX RETURNS, investigate #Trumprussia 
You lied
what are you doing for Arkansans beside spending your time on tv interviews????
Make sure Obama/HRC testify on why they sold 20% of our uranium reserves to Russia! #UraniumOne #LockThemUp
you need to push for 45 tax returns. A psychiatrist should be called also. #resist #StopTweetingStartLeading
You have no clue how Americans feel about "the wiretap with no source. A judge would allow a wiretap with no evidence?
We want Trump taxes and clarification of his wire tap allegations. Show us @POTUS hasn't lost his mind. #MAGA
Y R U & the other GOP enablers letting this mentally ill person destabilize R country? Where is ur patriotism?
mentally ill? Don't think he has been evaluated by Dr for mental illness. U saying it don't make it so!
I truly can't believe you support and defend Trump.
Sen. Cotton, U r wrong. Real Americans absolutely care that we're losing to authoritarian rule. DO SOMETHING.
Senator, do you realize it was Mr. Trump that tweeted the nonsense about President Obama - not unnamed sources
apologist for your morally bankrupt party and its lunatic leader
Weak! Def as much reason for "potential" concerns over wire taps by Obama as collusion Coons screaming about. @FoxNewsSunday
You GOP pussies should be outraged over the "potential" of the prez suspicions. We KNOW wire taps happened! @FoxNewsSunday
"Deserves full investigation." Dems have been talking about Trump campaign conversations. FACT. We KNOW that. @FoxNewsSunday
the
Refreshing. Congressman that can answer questions with a straightforward answer. No subject change. Good job
at least #chrisWallace trades you civilly unlike the abrupt rude way he hammered Sen @ChrisCoons
please be complete with your investigation. No matter how it shakes out the truth is always the best.
enjoyed the interview.  Russian contact is nonsense. But Clinton and BHO would be the thorns in the bushes.
we must #hang anyone guilty of #treason or aiding and abetting a #traitor
to the Taliban and five mass murderers for a traitor this is treason. Why hasn't he hanged for treason.
EXCELLENT job putting DEM Sniffer Wallace in his place. OBAMA is THE MAIN THREAT to our COUNTRY. NO MUSLIM GOV.
Great interview more informative than anything ive heard yet
I did and you sound like a tried and true political partisan who puts Party before Country! #shame #russiagate
you don't want hey bipartisan investigation talking y'all it's going to take more time if someone for the outside do it
Obama is a Muslim traitor. He sold weapons to iran and uranium to Russia and Iran. He gave five billion dollars
Thank U Senator 4 having our President's back, speaking intelligently UNLIKE McCain/Graham#FOSSILS
I wonder what kind of ppl election to office
your patience in answering the exact same question 25 times is remarkable. Kudos on calmness Senator!
Sir, I met you couple years ago and know your a good guy..But you sounded like Paul Ryan today. Letting us Down
Saw you on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. When it comes to intellectual honesty/integrity you are a transparent disgrace.
VERY impressed with you on fox news Sunday! VERY professional, didn't bash OUR President! Thank you. God bless
Excellent responses in the show. We need more Republicans to be on their toes in dealing with the media.
You did a great job in your interview with Chris Wallace, who tried his hardest! 
Please remember who is the current president. Thank you. @FoxNewsSunday
Yeah WTH:/
.@SenTomCotton @FoxNews is faux news to me. BTW I, your constituent, do care about Trump's delusional tweets. Follow him into battle?
Impressive interview!Tku for being a voice of reason. Ignore HRC/BO/soros bots,they're unleashed today!
Americans owed better than senators burying their head inthe sandTweets are his wrds not scripted speeches #countrybeforeparty
Those of who aren't bots are concerned about it & are letting our senators know. @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @MarkWarner
When are you calling @marklevinshow before congress to testify to his evidence?
I am an #American #Patriot from #Arkansas & I care about our #Country & am very concerned about crazy DT tweet. Scary u aren't
better get the Republican officials approved for the Russian investigation or we will b upset!
Stop speaking for "most Americans" the 23-24% that voted for your boy definitely isn't representative of MOST
We want tax returns and a special prosecutor. We also want Trump to apologize for lying. Again.
the only thing good abt trump presidency is he's taking ALL you guys down with him. It's only a matter of time.
Haven't quite figured out why U R aiding & abetting Trump. GOP agenda? Kompromat? Too much kool aid? Tin hat? 
You seem to be some what intelligent so it baffles your constituents.
you just keep selling out .. history will not be kind to you.
U said ur TH ?s were mostly abt HC "& the harm Obamacare has caused." Ppl who went to ur THs say this is a lie.
.@SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday Care to clarify about how the questions were mostly abt HC and "harm caused by Obamacare?"
No.
plz help our nation Senator-u are a of a handful of ppl we can trust! What has become of us? #watchOUTtraitors
Hey Tom. I'm from Arkansas and I totally care about the crazy ranting and Russian ties of Trump.
Have some decency Mr Cotton. You know very well Obama didn't wiretap Trump. Take responsibility as senator.
Any shock events by dangerously erratic WH will be responsibility of every republican rep who did nothing. You.
Wow; we saw interview. You may want to delete tweet promoting appearance. Or just yell: "Party over country!"
You look like you were going to cry. Clear the air, special prosecutor, now!  @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday
.Saw you @SenTomCotton on @FoxNewsSunday but they didn't exactly tweet what you said. Typical of this network now
back at home in Arkansas, you turn a blind eye to corruption in the workplace. Hope you never are disabled

Wait, the House already took care of that:  Remember  RESOLUTION
  66. H.Res.111
  @ConwayGay @SenTomCotton @FoxNewsSunday
he seems to be representing this constituent just fine thank you! 
Please investigate Obama and Valerie Jarrett as well as FBI and Obama justice Dept. There was wiretapping !!
Stand up for us Tom•We voted for Trump in Arkansas & we're with you. God bless you and God bless America
yes I'm sure you'd rather focus on the one/only decent teleprompter-read speech than the many unhinged tweets!
Investigate Obama admin abuse of power & Trump campaign surveillance. Make those FISA court warrants public.
TBD! #SNL Step up !!
Obama was bad for domestic energy production?!?!? We are the world's #1 fossil fuel producer! #stoplying
found your interview both troubling and disappointing. At what point do we put country above party?
don't continue to blame this on partisan politics. Do your job and investigate this objectively.
You're An amazing Senator!
love Trumps tweets!  Sick & tired of the media controlling the national narrative! Talk Directly to me tweet it
oh look, another Republican politician kissing Trumps ass. grow some balls Tom!
