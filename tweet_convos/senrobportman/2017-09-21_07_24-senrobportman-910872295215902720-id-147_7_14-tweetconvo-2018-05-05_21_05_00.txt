In YOUR state, there hasn't been an increase in Medicaid reimbursement for mental health treatment, in over 20 years...
...this is likely a contributing factor to today's #opioidcrisis. Increased need, insufficient treatment options statewide...
...so, cutting Medicaid will likely = greater crisis. Say it with me. #GrahamCassidy will likely lead to greater crisis.
Please Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill
Do you honestly think people don't see through this charade?
You know what else is needed more than ever? Comprehensive health care that includes substance treatment coverage. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
How will you vote on the healthcare bill?  You should really answer us. We vote.
So you're against Graham Cassidy, right?
Vote no to #GrahamCassidyBill and we'll listen to what you have to say.
Bipartisan plan for ACA market stabilization is the better path. #NoGrahamCassidy
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy health care!!!!  Pleeze......
Show your concern by not supporting/voting for Graham-Cassidy deathcare bill.
Drug free communities don't exist without health care
Graham Cassidy will literally spell death to those addicted to opioids. This is a medical crisis. Just look at the $$ #opioidcrisis
Sadly you intend to drown the addiction community by voting for the tidal wave of death. #votenograhamcassidy
How will the G/C bill effect drug treatment?  Better remember how tx is paid for for many citizens.  Vote NO on GC
And you position on Graham/Cassidy is? I don't think taking healthcare away will help the opioid crisis. Vote No.
And a cut to Medicaid will mean many addicts can't get needed treatment! Listen to your constituents & VOTE NO on the healthcare bill!
No funds 4 opioid crisis in Graham-Cassidy. Ohio stands to lose billions for treatment. How can you even consider voting for this travesty?
If Portman votes on bad health care then he should plan on retirement.
U vote 4 ACA repeal, MOST of your constituents will be on opioids to escape the pain of dying from various diseases. St Peter will ask why.
All the reason more to Vote No on #CassidyGraham
Being checked Non Hodgkin's lymphoma. 62 yrs.old. And you're going to vote me in dead. You're making me want to give up bc you don't care.
you vote to change healthcare you will wish you hadn't.
Well then don't vote for graham cassidy and tear healthcare away from Americans.
Vote NO on #Trumpcare
Yet you pretend to be undecided on #GrahamCassidy. Yes, the Koch money is nice, but what good is it if you lose your seat? #NoGrahamCassidy
Hey ya know haw you achieve this goal? Fully funding Medicaid to pay for mental health care as well as comprehensive MAT and IOP for addicts
President won't acknowledge Opioid Crisis. I've had 6 spinal & needed 7th cervical C2-C7 & 2 cysts on cord. I have AS,Fibro,Hep-C and now
Amidst Ohio’s opioid crisis, we need you to vocally oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill that would devastate our state. #VoteNo
Sadly you refuse to oppose GOP plans to destabilize the health care market. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Yet voting Yes for #GrahamCasiddy would take away money for programs like this! Vote No! Folks call say No!
Hi Senator. Please join the the Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose (& many other groups) in opposing #GrahamCassidy
The ultimate question on Graham-Cassidy.

Feel free to share if it helps people. 
It is hard to believe you care about the opioid crisis if you vote yes. Actions speak louder than words (or endless meaningless tweets)!
Your party is trying to buy Sen. Murkowski's vote by allowing Alaska to keep the ACA if Graham Cassidy passes.
If ACA is bad for country its bad for Alaska. If its good enough for Alaska then it is not the horror you have been portraying.
This is party over country to give Trump a win. Don't play this game. 
VOTE NO on Graham Cassidy
Please do not vote for the new health bill. Consider you fellow citizens of Ohio
Much like Medicaid, a crucial partner in treating those with substance use disorders
Vote no on latest health care bill. No lifetime caps is a MUST. No discrimination or higher premiums for pre existing conditions is a MUST!
Stable health care is needed now more than ever before. Don't destroy health care in the fight against opoids...VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy!
You don't care one bit about the #opioidcrisis. It's just a photo-op for you!
So is adequate healthcare, which your party seems determined to destroy.  Fix the ACA don't try to score a gotcha on the Dems.
I recently read the Koch Brothers aren't giving any more $ until healthcare is voted on. Why not just admit you care more about $ than #Ohio
We need healthcare for all Americans #FirstDoNoHarm Vote no on Cassidy-Graham healthcare bill.  Stabilize ACA with bi-partisan effort.
Then please do not help to pass the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.
how can pruit spend 60.000 on charter plains in such a short time but yet we can't afford decent healtcare for the tax payers
Vote NO on Graham/Cassidy or all your work on opioids crisis will be for nothing.
The ACA is also great for combatting the #opioidcrisis so vote no on #GrahamCassidy or the treatment for this will go away.
How will new bill affect those on drugs?
If there's a drug problem why are you taking away 32,000,000 Americans healthcare?
Leave my health care alone!!!!
These only work within a broader context, which includes treatment of which MAT is one. 50% of MAT in Ohio is funded by Medicaid expansion.
Your offices aren't answering calls and voicemails are full. G-C destroy healthcare markets. How does that help the opioid crisis?
So why do you support the latest GOP health care bill, Robbie? It Does NOT cover opioid treatment. Huh?
How about checking how many lawmakers took bribes from the Pharma co.s to push their poison on our kids.
ROB PORTMAN:  Will kill you for Koch cash

Graham-Cassidy contains ZERO funding for Ohio #opioidcrisis.
Then I hope you plan to vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill, since it would deny treatment to addicts who need it.
Drug free and healthcare free? No to #GrahamCasiddy

Aggreed and also Medicaid to help the addicted! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy The stakeholders say its will leave millions with no coverage!
Then why @senrobportman would you even consider joining the cowards who are supporting the repeal bill?
Good healthcare is also needed more than ever. Many healthcare providers, doctors and experts say Graham-Cassidy is NOT what we need.
You know what else is needed? Affordable addiction treatment.
Amen sist'a!!
Please put your money where your mouth is, @senrobportman . Vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyBill . Protect Ohioans fighting opioid abuse.
Too bad #TrumpCare will gut any funding to help fight this epidemic.

Do what is right and protect the people of this great state by voting NO on Graham/Cassidy.

Not to mention the 9billion dollars Ohio will lose-
Just like funding Ohio gets through Medicaid expansion.  You can't say you are for this program and vote yes on Graham Cassidy. VOTE NO!
Then why vote yes on a bill that doesn't get us any further ahead on funding
but yet you support a health bill that cuts funding for drug abuse. Grow some balls take a stand.
Answer us about HEALTH CARE!!! We know you're getting calls because we can't even leave msgs. #ProtectOurCare #CassidyGraham
And what is your position on #GrahamCassidy?  Voting No affects treatment options for those addicted.  Vote No!
And sadly, the #GrahamCassidy bill could exclude people like this who need it most. VOTE NO!
They also need healthcare Senator #votenograhamcassidy
Who do you & your staff report to? Ohioans, or mega 1%ers like Koch Bros? They must be pulling the strings hard, you've really shirked this.
Vote no on the Graham/Cassidy bill!
Too bad you're going to take away the Medicaid the addicts will need to overcome addiction.  #noGrahamCassidy #ProtectOurCare
YOU'RE SCREWING PEOPLE ON HEALTHCARE AND DON'T GIVE IT YOUR LIES THAT IT'S A BETTER PLAN IT'S NOT FIXED THE ONE WE HAVE
So sick of patronizing waste of breath from an elected official who's voting against taxing for healthcare.
REAGAN cut taxes.
RESTORE them!!
Vote no on GrahamCassidy


Do not vote for the health care bill that coming up please
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy or all your talk of fighting the opioid crisis & doing right by OH is just talk with opposite action.
People with health care issues like addiction get better when they have access to healthcare a concept even you should be able to grasp
Know what else is needed amidst the #opioidcrisis? Healthcare. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #gopisnotprolife
So is adequate healthcare. Vote NO on the Graham bill. Otherwise you crying about the opioid crisis looks like a sham. STEP UP!
All programs will disappear once cassidy-graham passes #Medicaid underfunded #OHIOANS 
True but this does NOT work without #Medicaid. Do not support #GrahamCassidy, please.  Protect millions with a NO vote. @JohnKasich agrees
Then make sure you vote no on the #GrahamCassidyBill. If it is passed it will make treatment less accessible.
Vote No on Graham-Cassidy and your dream will come true.
Kinda like gun free zones huh? That always works. SMDH
#opioidcrisis #opiworse with no healthcare to help them. Millions lost from Medicaid. Vote no if you really care #voteohionotparty
Know what's sadder? Politicians who want to rob addicts of essential treatment. Will you vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill?
If you truly care about stopping the #opioidcrisis you MUST vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. Or are you using opioids as a fig leaf?
Are you taking a stand against the #opioidcrisis because it's politically easy to do so?
No one can criticize you for being against the heroin epidemic, can they?
But we CAN criticize you for HYPOCRISY. Because #ACASavesLives. #GrahamCassidy will cut Medicaid to those addicts you claim to care for.
And you've already voted to rob those opioid addicts of Medicaid and essential healthcare. Will you do so again?
We can't criticize you for vocal opposition to the #opioidcrisis but we CAN criticize your cowardly silence on #ACARepeal & #GrahamCassidy
Are you a senator? Are you a leader? Or are you just a coward who uses opioid addicts as a shield while you hurt thousands of other Ohioans?
We need to stabilize ACA markets. Stop threats to CSR's. Bring down costs. Choose Medicaid over $6 HUNDRED BIL tax refund for the ultra-rich
Sadly, you seem to find all this complex. It's not complex, Rob! It's easy. Do the right thing. Bi-partisan plan for ACA stabilization
#GrahamCassidyCorruptGOP
Education, job training and jobs really work. Help people help themselves by creating jobs in hard hit areas.
Ohio will be 1 of the states most hurt by Graham/Cassidy bill
And the Graham/Cassidy bill takes away ALL money for opioid addiction
Hoping you vote no on this terrible healthcare bill. It does nothing to address the opioid crisis
Know what else is needed? Medicaid w/out caps and insurance that can't discrimate against those w/ preexisting conditions (like addiction)
Too bad this won't be covered under that monstrosity of a healthcare bill you will vote for!!  #spinelessrobportman
GOP leaders put $45b for opioids in their 1st Ocare repeal bill. Now it’s gone
Thoughts?
Save your words of care about opioid crisis. Means NOTHING if you vote for GrahamCassidy. You are just a sell out to the Koch Bros. VOTE NO!
200,000 Ohioans get opioid treatment from ACA and Medicaid which you will gut if you vote for Graham-Cassidy. Be a man of your word. Vote NO
You know what works better?  Addiction counseling, rather than declaring war on addicts.  Google it, Senator.
So are rehab and mental health services both of which could disappear under GrahamCassidy. OH stands to lose 9 billion $. You ok with this??
Center for American Progress estimates 809,000 in Ohio will become uninsured.
Since you care about the opioid crisis, you will be voting against Graham-Cassidy, right? Why don't you take a stand on it? Say something.
Vote no on graham cassidy. Horrible bill. Not fair! Improve ACA, stop this nonsense
Voting FOR #GrahamCassidyBill will negate this..... Ohio is watching!!!!
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy Not one major health organization supports this bill!
Why are you so quiet on your stance on #GrahamCassidy ? That's right, because you are a coward who blindly obeys daddy tRump. #lastterm
So is Medicaid.
What is NEEDED, Senator, is for YOU to OPPOSE the horrible Graham-Cassidy bill which will take $ away from Ohio opiod fight
You have been tweeting nonstop on every issue except the health care bill....WHAT IS YOUR POSITION!!!
I was wondering as well. Let's keep asking!!
@robportman are you okay with mass killings for profit?
Then you know how you need to vote on #GrahamCassidy. None of these essential services will survive that death bill.
Approve the new healthcare bill !! DO WHAT YOU PROMISED NOW!!
#GrahamCassidy IGNORES the opioid crisis.

Don't pretend to care, OPPOSE THE BILL!

#NoGCHJ
#SaveOurCare

#DontRobOurCare
#whatareyoudoing
#whereyouatRob
400 million to the GOP from the Kochs Brother to the GOP to get rid of Obama Care 12.50 a person for you to sell out Ohioans
#Countryoverparty
CONMAN @senrobportman voted to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a year receiving substance abuse treatment through Medicaid!!!
Why does GOP Graham-Cassidy bill gut support for fighting Opiod Crisis and helping those w/ addictions?
Healthcare, especially mental healthcare, is proven to work. Sadly, you and your colleagues are trying to rob your constituents of those.

medicaid is good also
You should kill this bill based on its destruction of our children's healthcare alone... #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE.
