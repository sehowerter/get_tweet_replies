Why does the GOP want to kill so many people. Instead of voting your party vote for your people.  Stand Up and don't let Trump bully you.
Get 'er DONE! Our President is waiting at his desk, pen in hand!

Hi! Me again. :)

The majority of Americans want #SinglePayerNOW. #ACA becomes irrelevant and you stay re-electable if you make it happen.
Just where did you get that majority, cause that's not what the stats show
Gallup, May 2016: http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx … 58% favor federally funded (AKA #SinglePayer) Where are you getting your stats?
Who does the Gallup poll.  Liberal think tank.  Don't go there and you know it.  Why do you think democrats are losing seats, there looks
uhm ... it's "their" ... Your Iq is on par with Your spelling--You are not alone; the entire GOP is Your companion....
I guess you don't ever have spell check change your wording, last 2 words do not fit.  If that is your only argument, you're a wait of time
crybaby ... its that Your only response, traitor?
THE REPUBLICAN DEATH BILL. You call yourselves pro-life? I laugh and cry. Stop hurting so many to give $ to rich. Shameful! #SaveACA
Repeal n replace with Medicare 4All. Software is there n provider choice goes back to Americans.
#No on Trumpcare
The GOP is standing by while the deep state and liberal left destroy the country. Protect the country, protect the party.  Quit selling out.
GOP repeals ACA, #resistance will repeal the GOP in '18. The political ads will write themselves. #resistgop #resisttrump #resistpence
@GOP needs to inform Murkowski, Collins, Portman, & Capito that they will be finding strong primary opponents for them since they are RINOs
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Murkowsi Collins Portman Capito Americans are watching & will work to rid all Rino's,rid us of Obamanocare
Remove your health insurance exemption you pass to your constituents. Share our care!
Please quit soliciting donations from me until you start supporting the President and his agenda.  You are embarassing.
#showUsYourPlan why should 30 Million Americans pay for the 1% tax breaks? What has America come to? Why do you hate the American people??
You should only be obedient to God&the People. You will loose your jobs on Capitol Hill and anything you run for back home.
Two things GOP. You better stop  Muller's sick hiring to take out Trump and you better repeal Obamacare.
Here we go again GOP Senate same O same O, B/S how many times are you going to Beat that Dead Horse?"Get It Done"! Drain the Swamp 
Yup, keep repeating the same lie and haven't become truth yet, keep trying
it does the people's work or it gets the people's hose. no lotion.
Liar liar all u want is take beak for rich
Talk is cheap.
I'm tired of lip service. Action on health care, lower taxes. Think midterm
Then Fully Repeal the Damn thing.  The problem is Mitch doesn't want it repealed.  And neither do most of you.
Been working on new plan for 7 yrs, why don't you already have a one to present. HHS is allowing ACA $$ to be used to fund anti-ACA videos.
Vote them out and impeach the traitor
You'll SORELY regret a repeal without a replace accepted by CBO, AARP & AMA. You Think #trump has your back? Who'se got his back?
I do, I want it fully repealed.  And let the market get back to normal while the fix healthcare not health insurance
Go BIG go BOLD or go home Fulfill your promise time to be #conservatives
GOP is Corporate Greed
Take from the Poor and give to the Rich. You are not a Republican nor a Democrat, Sir. You are without question, as I see you, a Plutocrat.
So now he's trying to fire Mueller, block investigations, and looking into pardons.
When will you do something? Failing us. @HouseGOP
Where are all of the Republicans who cared about foreign policy when it involved Hillary's emails? Most of those voices have disappeared
Only McCain and Lindsey Graham are speaking out. All of the other Republicans are scared. They are watching this go on but won't speak up
Republicans should not expect Americans to support them if they are unwilling to support us. Trump is doing everything Putin wants
Its unbelievable that Trump continues to make a mockery of American values and sell out to Putin, chicken shit Republicans remain silent
And Glenn needs to go to the looney farm
Traitor lover
Dummies, you can't even get the repeal of Obamacare. #blindleadingtheblind
y is trump telling  them to pull out?
Impeach the crook in the white house. Hue wants to see our voting records? We want to see his last 10 years of taxes first!!!
11/6/18 date where 33 Sen seats, all 435 seats in the House of Reps & 14 govs will be up for re-election. #NoAHCA #NoBCRA both are bad
Time to vote RINOS out. MAGA
Keep waffling & you'll see even more despicable liberals on your feeds.
Keep your damn word or we will vote your asses out, 
no more worries
The 5 RINOS voting against the repeal & replace,doesn't have a prayer for re-election.The  people that voted 4 Trump will make sure if it.
Kissing trumps ads screwing the American people Its all about the rich.
Quit talking and repeal it already
Keep your damn word and quit worrying about your job already, you might just be surprised
RUSSIAN STOOGES
We have healthcare.  GOP, stop making excuses and do your job.
You are so full of BULL! What did Obama mess up for your big pays that you want so bad to wipe out everything he did & blame game him & DEMS
Stop lying and engage your colleagues in a solution #resist @BBC
Nothing was done
This week you showed you do not care for anyone but yourself and now the country knows. it.
Somewhere in the near future? No! We want it now! You have sat on your lazy bums for too long! Fulfill your promise to the American people..
When will you acknowledge that our president's Russia problem? We are getting to crisis and you do nothing to defend democracy.
Just work with the Dems and fix the healthcare system. Your plans are going no where
At least someone is working for us
You must work together with your colleagues, your primary goal must be to protect your constituents and promote human rights #SDGs #CRPD
Simply provide the health care you all receive to all Americans, your healthcare is no different than Medicare or Medicaid
You have lost your way.  Jesus would be embarAssed by your behavior... the devil is in the WH and u lick his boots
I don't know why your #MurderCare bill can't get passed...
Repeal and return HC to states. Too much division on issues. Not a federal responsibility. #unleashfreemarket
So your solution is to give us something with less coverage for fewer people, and lots of tax breaks for m/billionaires?
More of the same talk, talk and talk, look out for ourselves while the rest of America suffers, get off your asses and get something done!
This week in the Senate: #WeDidntGetAnythingDoneExceptAFewShoddyAntiACAPropagandaVideos #GoverningIsHardFakeNewsIsEasy




Just cuz u keep saying it doesn't make it true. Over 80% of Americans want to fix the ACA.  SO FIX THE. ACA
Where exactly is that stat?  Just made up?
Business Insider March 23, 2017.  A google search will bring up supporting sources.
Again I ask, who is the source and where did the sample take place, it makes all the difference in the world where the sample was taken

Ok, this is a poll and it says everyone is against Trumpcare of which I am one but that doesn't say more want to fix Obamacare, I  disagree

Lie, lie, lie. Mislead, mislead, mislead. We're tired of it. So, so tired of it!
This week in the senate, how to cause the early preventable deaths of millions of Americans and cripple 1/6th of the economy
Since GOP likes big businesses, take a cue from Nike. Just say NO. Reverse the trend! Throw DJT Under the bus instead of cabinet and POLs
You all are traitors to Trump! We will vote you out Ryan and Mitch a bunch of traitors
America we must #DrainTheSwamp these R-Senators are RINO's #MAGA 
Vote them out that vote yes
SAD that GOP is the Russia loving party now! You condone Prez's bromance with Putin & say NOTHING about his dismantling our democracy-SAD!!
Many of you @SenateGOP are behaving like useless democrats & we (voters) are taking note. @POTUS @TPPatriots
Sweet talking bullsh!t
This week in the Grand Old #PartyOfLiars failure on healthcare. You people have no idea about governance. You here for us not lobbyist #fail
GOP must repeal and replace healthcare now. President Trump was right to call you out. Compromise and get it done.
"DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM"
You deliberate and do nothing for what you were elected for....traitors to the people who voted you in....repeal don't replace free market
"DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM" "DO NO AMERICAN HARM"
What planet do you guys live on? Just wondering.
The GOP Congress plan is Heaven for the rich Oligarchs and Hell for the rest of America!

Repeal w/out a replacement is a cruel and irresponsible plan.
One question, why
You guys never knew how to govern, only defund stuff or kick it down the road.
When you have contempt for government, you govern with contempt.  #DumbMantras

Perhaps people can work together and help each other with healthcare instead of just taking care of themselves. Their situation may change.
I served America Honorably Treating Americans and their Families. No one went without care!

TIME CONGRESS DO THE HONORABLE THING ACA STAYS!
When the person with no health care comes to work with a virus on their breath you will wish they also had health care. Germs spread.



More fake crap from republications!
Trump is not able to tell the truth. He even believes his own lies. His wife can't sleep with him because Putin's snoring.

Exactly
Broken record. Quit sabotaging it and America and fix the ACA.





And replace it with what? 
Just because McConnell tells you what to say and believe doesn't mean you need to follow the idiot!

"DO NO AMERICAN HARM!"

Tell the Senate to hold hearings from experts and stakeholders on any vote. Open democracy expects it. #NoHearingsNoVote
@SenCoryGardner your fate depends on your vote if you dare to harm one American!

Stand tall Cory and vote "NO" to repeal of our Great ACA!
Sentencing 60,000 Americans to their death annually with Trumpcare has the @GOP Jakals salivating blood.
You guys are ruining it by defunding it. Stop lying and help people instead of hurting them. Get a life and a conscience while you're at it
Repub have been spending money that was allocated to promote OCare instead they are using the funds to mutilate OCare to promote Repub plan.
I hope this is not just more B.S. from the Republican Senate.
Do your job, keep your promise.
Repeal Obama-Care!
Do It!
You think you are immune to sickness and injury. News http://flash.You  are not.
@SenCoryGardner 

"DON'T YOU DARE CORY GO ALONG WITH HARMING ONE AMERICAN!"

"DO NO HARM TO ANYONE IN AMERICA!"
thank you 4 reminding us that the GOP has no solution after 7 years & showing us the faces of those that wish to destroy 1/6 of the economy
Vote out all that voted yes
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Big idea 1: the Cruz amendment.

Creating 2 pools. No one believes this works including prominent Republicans analysts. 6

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
@SenCoryGardner 

"DO NO HARM TO NO AMERICAN!"
Actions talk! Bullshit walks.  Like Charlie Brown & Lucy with football.

Ok.  So are you gonna sit on your hands again.  Or, are you actually going to do something?
Please don't. You might want to check poll numbers before proceeding

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Our families are relying on you to get it done
you guys are all bumbling around the hill like Mr. Magoo. You're all pathetic.
Do you know what the definition of crazy is? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Just stop.
I wont vote in congressional elections ever again. Only presidential elections. I want tax cuts, better healthcare, a smaller government
We've seen these threats to attack our health care system before, and they've always faded. Let's hope this one does as well.
Lies and more lies. Your BS rhetoric had 7 yeas and enough is enough. You should be criminally charged for sabotaging ACA. Vile crew U R
"This week in the Senate...our party fell apart!"
You guys are a laugh.
Lol
