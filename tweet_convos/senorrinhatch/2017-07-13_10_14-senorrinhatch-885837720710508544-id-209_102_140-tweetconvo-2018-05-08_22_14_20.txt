@GOP lovesRomneyCare.

Julie Champine makes a great case 4 universal healthcare. Uninsured costs passed on to us raise med costs! Countries w/ univ cov- lower cost
Sure wait until the GOP gets done 'fixing' healthcare, premiums will be unaffordable for almost all of us and actually cover nothing
Please vote no on #BCRA & #ProtectOurCare. Please!
...because ALL insurance costs are going up, plus ACA is tied to income & we lost my husband's income due to his Alzheimers. #SaveACA
I couldn't afford to pay COBRA, which was 5X more than ACA premium, so ACA has been a godsend for us. Alz Assoc came out against GOP plan /2

Total #baloney - you will be killing people by taking away coverage #Lies
And the republicans want us to pay more money! What do they pay?
All I hear is talk talk talk as usual from republicans. You promised a repeal of Obamacare. If If Mitch Mc Connell cannot deliver step down
Julie, darling, hope you are paid for this (R) ad. they have had 7yrs +months and can not give the American people what they need.
@POTUS Y Senate put $45 Billion 4 OPIOID in, which is 40 X MORE than #BHO put? USA =320M #PPL of 7Billion on Earth & USA use 70% World DRUGS
None of the GOP ideas for health care would help this person unless she is extremely wealthy.
You can thank the republicans for that not the ACA, they did everything they could to sabotage the exchanges.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
.@SenateGOP would rather take away healthcare than remove a #TraitorINChief
What a bunch of bull.
Healthcare fix for everyone.
That is from the greedy insurance companies not the ACA
Single-payer system now
Shame on you for categorizing this citizen as a victim. Bipartisan action is needed to improve the Marketplace. #ACA has also helped many.
So fix the problem don't gut the system.  And get rid of the Russian operative running the country.  #YourLeadershipIsDeafening
Let’s see you submit this..
Demonizing Obamacare doesn't magically make your bill a good bill. You don't solve the very problems you are complaining about. Dishonest.
Don't worry, they will be worst if they pass Trumphellcare.
.#USA  @SenateMajLdr @GOPSenate NO GOV. CONTROL OF HEALTHCARE! REPEAL & FREE MARKET! GET OUT OF #AMERICAN EXAM ROOMS! UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!
How about you sell me on your plan instead of selling me on repeal.
Your bill will raise premiums.
Reducing Increases is NOT a Medicaid cut.Choice&competition across states&mandates removed will reduce costs&will  give us better HC product
The only "victims" of ACA are those who are too dumb to know that GOP fucked them over on purpose so they could have an issue for campaign.
Now do yu job and at least get rid of Obamacare.
Another 1%
Per @ChrisMurphyCT - THEY DID IT AGAIN- New version of #Trumpcare exempts Congress. Trump garbagecare for us- OBAMACARE FOR THEMSELVES.
Time to shed some light on Insurance Plan Administrator costs and Transparency of their practices.  Too much $$ wasted.
Time for a single payer universal health care system.
She's a "victim" because her deductible is high??? What about 23K who will loose healthcare completely under your bill? Some very ill.
More propaganda to dismantle the ACA & throw millions off health care!  Disgusting!
You are forgetting the millions of people who it helped. Like me.
Uh, may want to check when that started. Rs in Congress started refusing to pay up what was owed.
I'm a conservative, saddened by the fact republicans have had literally years to create new healthcare bill, instead you look like children
#fakenews
Strikes me that for every negative example you post like this there are hundreds of positives. Politicians are the same the world over!
welcome to my world before Ocare. 10,000ded 1280/mo ind hlthcare before Ocare.Child w autism wasn't covered. This doesn't add up
Insurance companies produce nothing except paper and make approximately 50% plus profit. You are ready to give them more. Shane
#Repealdontreplace
Take care of Julie by taking ACA & improve it where it needs it-we don't need to rebuild the wheel. Put yourself aside & take care of Julie
Julie needs to call her senator & tell him to vote NO to today's bill because she & her co-workers will be worse off w/ what you offer
GOP desparately wants to reward the wealthy with a tax cut and pay for that on the backs of people who dont have healthcare.
Julie can blame Trump and GOP who wanted to cripple ACA so they would have the pleasure of saying a plan created by OBAMA failed
She's a victim because her President ceased paying subsidies to insurers in ACA--they either dropped out, or raised premiums and deductables
All because DJT & GOP has sabotaged the ACA with lies and negative propaganda & defunding
But you're NOT victims are you or your staffs or families you were waivered! I want your plan you can have mine!
And they are going to get worse if GOP has way
So fix the problem. Be specific. Repair, repair, repair. Hard work but it's what needs to be done. Specific solutions for specific problems.
You're a Trump victim! Wake up! If Trumpettes hadn't threatened pulling plug on insurance $$ you wouldn't have this problem to deal with!!
@nytimes  How will Julie feel about paying more for health care and receiving less benefits when the GOP takes $800 from Obamacare?
It's disgusting to see you introduce her as an Obamacare victim to some spooky music. No specifics, just classless like the POTUS you serve.
We were promised repeal/replace--NOT propping up Obamacare. We're going to vote you freaks out if you don't get with the program to #MAGA
@IngrahamAngle just saying Laura...
Then get rid of it! .@RandPaul has a good plan. Quit swindling the citizens with Obamacare lite MUST REPEAL & REPLACE! Midterms are coming.
Why rebuild the wheel? Take the ACA & improve it where there are problems. Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. And no tax cuts
Single payer, eliminate the middleman! Take your greedy fingers out of the pie!
I have no R in the Senate as Califonia has gone socialist.  We rely on other state's R's.  Please get going we need to save America.
When will you swallow your pride & work with @SenateDems to come up with a bipartisan plan that would benefit PEOPLE?
Rand Paul please stop and get on board.  You can tweak the laws later to meet your needs.  You must pass this Cruz amendment
@housegop It seems ur plan is no better.Thought republicans were free mkt thinkers.The voters r. CONGRESS NEEDS to be replaced w/businessmen
So Suasan Cllins want to sellout the rest of the R's in the Senate and become a minority again eh?  What is wrong with her brain>
Yes have to be RICHto get insured under Obamacare  so please do something cannot afford premiums and deductibles ts outrageous!!!
Please make it happen. Obamacare is not the answer. Obamacare should never have happened in the first place.
For every 'Julie' there are hundreds for whom Obamacare worked perfectly until Reps started taking it apart by cutting financial support!
All know GOP has sabotaged ACA since the get go. After yrs of repeal motions, you have yet to offer better. Nov 2018 the answer. Pathetic.
To which YOU sabotaged!!!  Americans know what you have done !!!
So, what say you, GOP Republicans?  Did you get this?  Repeal and replace!
GOP #Hiring:

 Willing to collude with a Foreign Government
 Good at lying
 If caught colluding MUST be able to lie over & over again

first #GOP sabotages #ACA by creating uncertainty. then #GOPCare proposes cutting funding for healthcare. less money=less healthcare. #fixIt
You guys are, literally, awful
Try telling the truth at least once and on something this important.
Off the charts or off the healthcare list? Which is more damaging? Liars.
Senator Mitch McConell, there's nothing wrong with the ACA so please leave it alone!
.@SenMajLdr is a waste but Ocare is horrid. I had to drop it when my premiums exceeded my mortgage. #ObamacareIsNoCareForMiddleClass
I'm sorry to hear that. I am a California resident but my premiums always stayed the same. I think your insurance is fleecing you.
The first problem is you created it.
Now to deal with this problem you would be in your best interest to bring forward a single payer system
Stop embarrassing the county, constituents and yourselves. You were not elected to obstruct but to GOVERN. Get the bill to the floor NOW!!
#Brainless You won't have to worry about that when you have NO healthcare.

If the @GOP Senate Republicans really want to help, vote for this bill to bring it to the floor and offer amendments. We'll let Dems offer.
why not put an age cap of 40 on skimpy plans? That'll increase enrollment and limit cost increases to those with preexisting conditions.
Wasted time, Lies from the GOP & broken promises. #FullRepeal & #RepealNow!
Quit blaming Obama for what you haven't been able to accomplish in SEVEN YEARS. You own this. Get your party to work with Dems for once.
Pass your bill or shut up 
Your new bill is garbage just like last one & provides tax cuts for rich and hurts Americans.
Do something, repeal the despicable #Obamacare
Have you considered that it's not Obamacare that needs to be fixed, it's the whole healthcare system?
and you think your deductibles will be less? Only if you don't have pre-existing conditions, get pregnant, or need hospital.
I just had a colonoscopy.  The price?  $15,000 with insurance!!!
I have insurance thu ACA but colonoscopy, mammogram are free & I get insurer discount on diagnostic tests til reach deductible. #SaveACA
Do you have a pre-existing condition Julie?  If yes, you may not be able to get insurance under #Trumpcare #Wealthcare
This @SenateGOP is horrible but so is Obamacare for the middle class. I had to drop insurance when premiums exceeded my mortgage.
How old are you Julie? Better check out what the premiums will be under Trumpcare for your age.  If 50, premiums may be 5 times more!

There new plan lower cost Gives less and really hurt preexisting conditions. Why do They cheat US
Republicans celebrating their new #Obamacarerepeal plan:is not repeal.replace, it's preserve and expand. #GOP are stupidest #morons on earth
No multi payer system will ever be fair for everyone. 30% admin waste. Too many gaps. #SinglePayerNow
The dimms took a perfectly good system & designed aca to intentionally fail, to get to single pay. Control 1/5 econ + everybodies lives.
"basic human right"? What about food, shelter, clothing? Where does personal responsibility fit in? Nany state!
1) Dems didn't design ACA to fail; GOP didn't work w/them, Red States rejected Medicaid expansion. 2) ACA is middle-class safety net .../1
Trumpcare would jump premiums for 50+ 54% increase. Obamacare increase cost 10% vs Trumpcare increase cost 17%.
No money to bail out insurance company.  It is not our problem
why don't you ever show clips of the millions that have insurance now? Or people who are alive because of it?
This is because of your efforts to sabotage it. Seriously, your racism is staggering. #NoTrumpCare #SaveACA
You sit there with health insurance we pay for, we should all have what u have as single payer.
TRUMP CARE victims:  All low and middle class families with existing conditions!
Insulin has gone up in price 3000% in last 25 years, while price of manufacture has gone down. CEO Pay UP 1000X, GOP are Merchants of DEATH
A big lie. There will be more victims from republicans bumping people of their health care so that the rich minority can have a tax break
TrumpCare means she will not have insurance.
Thanks to "Obama Care" I was able to continue to work, support my family, and pay taxes. Without it, long term disability
Don't believe this women either.
The @GOP is really the party of stupid if they don't repeal Obamacare and work with Democrats on "fixing" what can't be fixed.
Any of you little whiny RINOs want to work with Democrats, you might as well join them because the @GOP will be the minority party anyway.
Fix the flaws in the ACA, stop trying to rob the elderly, the sick, the children of care!
#HealthcareBill Senate Republicans, Obamacare can't be fixed. The Dems don't want to "work with you", they want to blame you.

This is dishonest.  Premiums rising because GOP choking  Ocare. Under new bill, you are likely to do worse. And, need Medicaid? Forget that.
Yes-they are conveniently not telling Americans that insurers are pulling out of ACA because Trump ceased paying subsidies to them
Sad that u exploit people
Also, @SenateMajLdr stop saying Dems are obstructing when you're party can't agree on a plan. I Don't think @RandPaul is a dem?
.@RandPaul is one of a few #GOP who is actually standing w/the ppl who voted to #MAGA. These RINO's are simply propping up Obamacare.
Look at the bill, it only gets better if u r young & healthy. Otherwise, ur pretty much screwed. Even insurance comp & doctors hate it.
Where are your Obamacare winners? Or are the people I know just lying? be cool if you made current legislation more inclusive
Explain how #BetterCare will reduce premiums and deductibles...use this person circumstance as an example, also a person with a PreExistCond
Blah blah bla , saboteurs


Well, we've now seen the revised Republican #Trumpcare bill. Little has changed. 
Look at the new bill that GOP came out with which will MAKE HEALTHCARE WORSE LESS INSURED 50M PRICES HIIGHER NO SAFETY NET
Get the facts - listen to @AliVelshi

Yes, we know what mischief you've been up to injecting uncertainty to derail access to healthcare. It's embarrassing. We need single-payer.
Running this one again.  Not sure this woman is even real. Tried to do a web search. Can't find her on any social media.
Repeal Obamacare - do not fix; no bailout for insurance companies!
100% SABOTAGING OF OBAMACARE BY TRUMP AND THE GOP CONGRESS.

READ THIS .....CLICK IMAGE TO ENLARGE
This is exactly the problem with leaving insurers in the equation.  It is the reason medicare for all is the correct solution.

Victims? Dramatic much? MEDICARE FOR ALL. They wouldn't be victims if you weren't deliberately sabotaging the ACA and lying about it.
Yeah try $15,000 I said $15,000 that's a deductible and your rates go up 72% you want to keep that around let it collapse Dems will do then
You're doing nothing. You don't have the courage to do the right thing and repeal Ocare completely
And yet another story of insurance companies in charge of politicians & our healthcare crushing the people.Medicare for all.#medicareforall
What happened to Trump saying there would be no lobbyists. Pressure insurance companies & pharmaceuticals to lower their ridiculous prices
So, she's a victim of Republican undermining of exchanges, and lack of support for Obamacare.
This "healthcare" bill is a subsidy for millionaires. #Trumpcare is immoral, and so are the @GOP @SenateGOP @SenateGOP
YUP! The combined net worth of 8 senators creating the bill is over $84 million. Even worse is the median income of people from their states
Wait till the poor woman sees what your plan will do.
American families are stretched thin enough already. They can't afford the Senate's higher-cost, less-coverage health care bill. 
So make the insurance companies fix the deductibles. Don't throw 22 million off insurance.
Meet Obamacare champions, like my cousin, who was able to start her own business and afford meds that keep her alive thanks to Obamacare
Just wait till u see whats coming. You gonna pray for return of Ocare
2018 b*tches.
If healthcare is the real issue then fix it without a tax break - which is the real goal in this charade
Stop wasting time on repeal and improve the #ACA. The GOP plan is far worse.
Agreed! Can the @GOP show that their new plan no longer guts #Medicaid for schools? How will her child access therapy when this is cut?
TRUMPCARE will keep as many as 7 million veterans from participating in the GOP healthcare plan. This is not how you treat your protectors?

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Trump promised--repeatedly--not to touch Trump voters Medicaid. The bill he backed savages Medicaid. $880 billion in cuts.
Stop whining, get to work and fix the ACA!
You have an AWESOME name!!! 
Thank you.  You too!
#FullRepeal ....  NOW
