Same guy who wants American Cos. to create new jobs in America or face penalties - how ironic DJT never practiced what he preaches
There's no problem with starting a company overseas that is staying there. The problem is one here outsourcing over there
yeah just like trump did with ALL his companies including buying China steel for his American properties. Check it
He didn't say you couldn't buy from over seas. "It's been checked!"
don't protect Judah read the facts of all things evil by DJT in the Making of Donald Trump (best sellers list)
I don't read fiction. The only evil thing that has come out of his mouth is Clinton's name.
@marcmalkin Hey @POTUS #BLOTUS wants to make sure he makes the money from #TrumpEscorts
On the picture DJT looks like what he is.... a fat cat
who is going to investigate if it violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution.  Congress is giving 45 a pass. #dotheirjobs
More like Drumpf gives the Republican Congressmen a "cut of the action".
we have an absolute criminal as President. Everything he does.
agreed
He's planning to sale all liberal idiots to China hope y'all enjoy the stay!!! lol... got to love NBC bias! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Trumpettes, the dumbest people on the planet.
lol look in the mirror!
conflict of interest trump a chartaltan
who cares, he is not in charge of his business, his sons are...... what a disgraceful article. #sickfakenews #sickNBC
Drumpf, "what conflict of interest?"
Conflict of interest. Where does this stop? When does Congress step in?
I wonder what the "presidential package" will consist of? #oligarchy #presidentpimp #showers
@SenatorCardin when you get the truth ......put it out, until then be quiet
More and More conflict of interest   NO INTEGRITY   TRASON
Hes doing all this crap an nothing is being done about it..
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS45__ IMPEACH THE DAMN LOW LIFE
.@NBCNews  I tweeted this last week.  Sorry you're slow to report but appreciate that you finally DID report. Thank you.
made in China!!!!!
of course it's a conflict of interest. Trump has been trying to get those TMs for years, now they grant all? Illegal!!!!
What the Hell is Trump up to? Receiving money from Foreign Powers violates the Constitution Emoluments Clause, right?
#ImpeachTrump
Fake news. He turned over control of the business operations. This has been well documented. Just stirring the pot of nothing. smh
And he never severed ownership, just day-to-day management!
TRUMP MADE IN CHINA
YOU R FAKE NEWS #fakenews
NBCNews  Really NBC is there anything that you won't do to divide this country and cause anarchy?
Where is the GOP ?????
Oh brother.. Keep trying to create fake news/scandals NBC. You have just been overtaken by the National Enquirer.
This is why a narcissistic business man should never be a president, as he will use the country to be the means for his own gratifying gain.
Another scandal to investigate, appoint a special prosecutor.
how many times a day does he stick his thumb up his ass?
This should be no surprise. Trump said he would make a lot of money as POTUS. @realDonaldTrump
China is smart, they stroke Trump's ego and benefits PRC, may even get him in trouble and rid of him in US
Investigation needed. He is up to no good!
The rich get richer no matter where they are. Nobody will do anything about this.
And not one  freaking thing will be done about it. Trump has carte blance to do whatever he pleases so he does. No account idiots
trump is going to milk the presidency for all he can
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP <-- these people do nothing, they are complicit in these wrong doings
#EmolumentsClause #CORRUPTION #SoCalledPresident #TimeToGo #stuffinghisownpockets #laughingallthewaytothebank #INEPTPOTUS
so Trump have ties to China like Russia.
So do we now go after China on top of Russia? I mean seriously, this man was supposed to turn his company over as it is mandated
#Impeachtrump
And what is any one doing. Nothing
#TheResistance thinks the #emoluments just made to #TRUMP @POTUS will make relations w/ #China much smoother now. #ThanksDonnie NOT
That's okay if a rich man of privilege gets over, the American way#
@AnconaCarole 
Why does this continue to be allowed?! GOP leaders can't be this selfish and ignorant about our Constitutional laws?
The more you know the easier the fight. Don't forget the Russia connection. #POWER TO THE PEOPLE.
Electing Trump is like letting a pedophile babysit a group of kids....#motleypr.com
DO all the REPS have that smirky, $hit eating grin as their enlistment into the camp of a$$holes embedded into character.
NBC is full of it wouldn't report on this during election
why is nothing being done to stop Trump's corruption?
Tell us something we don't know. Q. What are you going to do about it
-no conflict as shown by Trump's tax returns & his blind trust while POTUS. All else is lies, fake news!
let's add China to the list: Russia--tax returns--Russia--tax returns--Russia--tax returns--Russia--tax returnsRussia--tax returns-
More FAKE NEWS from NBC. The President is not req'd by law to sell or divest anything.  Go back to journalism school!
support our president! You dont need to like him...but support him!
no support for a criminal
Trump is shameful.
Why is congress just standing there, party before country. We wii remember.
And what? Pick party over country like they have been doing since Bill Clinton.
you are coo coo, nice try at deflection
the most corrupt to occupy the WH ever. Slimy
@FoxNews @CNN @maddow @ABC @CBSNews  Trump waited 10 years for China trademark  now has 38. Where are investigating reporters? Sad
GOP is protecting Trump. GOP needs to be investigated.  #investigateRyan #investigateMcConnell.
wouldn't be the first conflict of interest he has had since Jan 20th
Must be lots of Americans working in China, for Trumps; "Hire American, buy American" plan.
oh gee, who didn't see this coming--all about him and not about the American public. What happened to"let's build American"
What's happening with this?Are we just going to let this stuff slide?
nothing is happening or will happen...it's not letting it slide, it's called following the law!
are we suprised?
Namesake. He removed himself from the businesses. His kids have the same last name. It's not a conspiracy. Get over yourselves.
Of course.He is crooked to the core.That's what's it's all about to him.
keep working. Obviously the government is not going to watch him at all
He doesn't run those businessed any more, so no conflict.
there's no conflict, nice try. More fake news coming in sure.
No conflict there!! Trump brand has been around for eons and will continue!!
HAHAHA.  Of course!!  What's good for a delusional President must be good for the nation.  Bull
#FakeNews Trump isn't involved with his company anymore so there is no conflict of interest.
Of course but he is making no money lol
@CNN @FoxNews @PressSec @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump taxes taxes
o wow. And he says he's bringing back jobs to America. That's bullshit.
......this dude is a joke....in way over his head....and has double standards......
conflicts of interest for Trump, period.  This Administration is corrupt beyond words.  CORRUPT w/a possible TRAITOR in the WH.
This guy's out for himself, and hasn't a care for the rest of us. If you think otherwise, you're naive it just stupid.
You couldn't make the Russian thing stick, so.....let's try China. LOL
Trump is FAKE NEWS and stupid,  we need to impeach him.
there was a perceived conflict of interest as soon as he won the election.
blah blah blah there's actual news happening
:Trump businesses with 38 new trademarks.. Why would anyone raises to question President Donald Trump , but where are tax details ?
I truly believe USA is a lost cause. 1940s UK sighed a sigh of relief when US joined the fight against fascism. Who is there now?
@realDonaldTrump This would be answered if he released his taxes.  He should not be allowed to continue without releasing taxes.
You should run for congress and change the law then
HE said he would release them if elected...throw another lie on the #MountainOfLies
follow the money
so why is nobody using the emoluments clause and start impeachment
LOL you make accusations in the same sentence you complain about them.
Money, loot, prize, that witch we value most here in the US. Other principals, Prevarication never telling the truth, evade.
He needs to be impeached!!!!! Worst president in our history as a nation!
It is a conflict of interest# He gets away with anything illegal, ALL the time. When will ppl call him on his actions. #NotAboveLaw
Any ethical American should question this and want the truth. Conflict of intrest bigly. This should not be ok with anyone.
'I'm in the money, C'mon my honey..."
serve and deflect---his kids out behind scene promoting brand--
i guess he really IS above the law--all people are afraid of him
what law are you referring to that he is above? Federal law exempts all presidents from conflicts of interest
And of course nothing will be done about it!
What can be done? Any president is exempt from conflicts of interest
lol he wins again
@stevemacwv what the heck is going on here? Follow the money & you'll find why DT is making more money as POTUS than before, releas
are people really that naïve to not think he wasn't going to protect his business interest even if it was a conflict of interest?
Oh gee really? I can't imagine WHY?
so he waited 10 years for a Chinese Trademark and now has 38, what a coincidence.
@JustSchmeltzer @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr congress go investigate that we are going to hell in a hand basket do u even care
the great American leader is busy 'brining jobs back from China'. This is fake news leaked by Obamaians...
by the way the  'escort services' that Trump opens in China  is a good business as Putin said referring to Moscow girls...
At the center of everything (Russian collusion, bad policy, etc) is that the Trump family is using presidency to enrich themselves.
year it just shows Trumps idea for make America Great Again runs through China. Wonder how his Cult will spin this.
meanwhile, there is no one heading @uspto ...
FAKE NEWS according to @realDonadTrump This Adm is about self-serving from day one. Soon he'll announce he loves China. Get him out
@ehwilk @NBCNews @realDonadTrump
China will let us know if it's pay for play. When and if they revoke them it will be after he does something to displease them.
And, the illegal presidency continues to roll right along with nary a care in the world. Because literally no 1 cares 2 stop him. 
We r an embarrassment & a joke 2 the rest of the world & it will remain that way 4 a long time. 
I beg 2 differ. There r some American ppl who r the joke. The racists & white nationalists who want a different country. 
Trump is the saviour of humanity.  Wealth will no longer have any meaning. The name Trump will be platinum itself. @NBCNews
A modified corruption plan of Trump !!
His sons runs his business, so no, not really.
As he said during the campaign, "Look at that face, would anyone vote for that?" #ResistTrump
WAKE UP AMERICA! This guy is a con!
억
@realDonaldTrump that PHONY needs to be gone.
they all need to go
Hard to hide from Success.  Glad he is our President.
deplorable....
Thank you.
You need to say that he has been in court 10+yrs over one TM already owned by a Chinese national. Apologized for Taiwan & approved
Follow the  #TrumpRussia
- We are entering into a very dangerous time with Trump as president. Our Republic is being destroyed by this man. It shouldn't be.
Business run by kids. Trump not on the take like the Clinton crime foundation
Phil, you are wrong.  Clinton story was fake.  Look at 990's
More propaganda
The timing is what's damning. Most were on hold until after he got elected. @potus is enriching himself.
Just like the "coincidence" that Mar-A-Lago doubled its membership fee and he's spent almost every weekend there.
@InSpiteOfTrump Trump has been seeking this for a decade. Timing is everything
Maddening!
why is this allowed? @GOP this must be changed.  U r demeaning the office
THIS CRAP IS GETTING TOTALLY OUT OF HAND!!!
this conflict of interest shit gets on my nerves,He's a businessman not a bloodsucking politician
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  you can do this why? No blind trust yet! u r still running ur bus. bc FrickFrack are incompetent w/o Daddy
More conflicts of interest & ethical violations regarding our wonderful president.
I will never to refer to that PHONY @realDonaldTrump as pres.  He is unfit, a liar, a libeler, and unethical.
Repubs and Trump are looting the US like W Bush and wall street did.
Now sold in China, Trump hair products, trump self tanner, Trump erectile disfunction pumps & Golden Trump dump toilets
Suddenly Republicans have no problem with pay-for-play.
Suddenly Democrats have a problem with pay-for-play.
ignorant asses, he was a business man before he became president. We voted for him w/ knowledge he was an international bus man
I thought the President couldn't have conflicts of interest.  At least that's what I heard people saying.
Made in America??
@jasoninthehouse @OfficeGovEthics But a president can't have conflicts, right? #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice
A President is exempt from conflicts of interest, you are correct.
face it @realDonaldTrump used his office to advance his biz interests. Doing this allows @GOP to screw US. Good times!
We all know he slams others for sending jobs overseas even as majority of the Trump companies are in China and Mexico.
DO YOUR JOBS AND INVESTIGATE @SenateDems @SenateGOP !
it's a miracle!
get him out.
How are they serious questions when he simply brushes them off?
Questions?  I mean, damn!  How stupid do you have to be to NOT figure this out?
