Is China trying to get him impeached?
the world hates trump when we have a huge march many countries march in solidarity with us
The day before this came out, they warned not to stir anything w/ NK. I'm considering this bribery.
what does @SenSanders says about it he will let us know
Who cares what @SenSanders has to say on this? We all know what it is: a bribe.
well Maria, united in truth we win we don't operate in propaganda like they did we seek the truth
Again, I'm not sure why I should care what @SenSanders says. I care what impartial investigators say.
sbsolutely think you forgot who your enemy is and it's not me
Awesome isn't it, & the one for the escort service was approved too So #Precedential #Impeach 
So WHEN do impeachment hearings begin already?! Come ON. Enough talk w/ this,Dems! Show some ovaries!
bahahahaha. You don't understand how our government works do you?!
Oh, honey. Grow up. In the meantime, you bore me so easier to just block you. Good luck. I can see you need it.
@DimoreeP yea so why no impeachment?  He's violated since day one. Why is he being enabled to do half the crap he's doing?
Keep up the fight Ben! Such a mensch!
Historians believe Abe was working on an escort service, but Lincoln Likeable Ladies Escort Service never launched.
. WHAT DID YOU PROMISE them DONALD?? YUR reputation persues you TRUMP. Crooked, LIAR, SNEAKY, CORRUPT, want MORE!
What will you do about this Senator Cardin?
So get to work and start the impeachment process. #stoptweetingstartimpeaching
Please Senator, we all need you.  Impeach this thief.  I beg you.
Get him Senator Cardin
So what good is this Emoluments Clause if we're just going to ignore it?
Problem is, Congress doesn't seem to give a shit.
@pdacosta @POTUS China knows how to speak "trump"
@lil_a777 - Hey, @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @SenateGOP - Curious if you could maybe do your jobs? Investigate. Impeach.
So why is the DOJ sitting on it's collective hands?
Why is this being allowed to happen? Our national security & sovereignty is in danger. #Russiagate #IndependentInvestigation
###EmolumentsClause  I wish this were the worst of Trump's transgressions against the American people. Please stop him
One if for Massage Parlour, others equally icky #TrumpCopyright #TrumpEgo #TrumpLies #TrumpRussia  #TrumpEmolument
@lauralino @POTUS Emolumentally obvious violation.
-Can't wait for @NormEisen & @RWPUSA 2Fight this.
And one of them was for an escort service so now @realDonaldTrump is Pimp in Chief - fitting for a sexual predator.
This demands an investigation
Waiting eagerly for the IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS. Tho would prefer Election annulled, Clinton installed.
don't hold your breath on this one.  DT will serve two full terms. Haha
Does he have Congressional approval?
@dpgumby @HouseDemocrats at some point we're going to net the house to Step Up!
what more do you need from the people to start impeachment proceedings? That malevolent being must be stopped
One of those Chinese trademarks was for an "Escort Service."  #PresidentPimp #ImpeachTrumpNow
@MikeOkuda @POTUS /now/ can we impeach him please?
@realDonaldTrump #impeachTrumpnow #ImpeachTrump #impeach #LiarInChief #russiagate #Russiaghazi #GOPHASNOBALLS #SAD!!!!
@sacca @POTUS thing is- this servile milquetoast Congress bows to him
Interesting. Right after he "changed" his mind & agreed 1 One China Policy. Coincidence? Or art of the deal? 
#resist
Making trump officially a Chinese pimp. Still, it'll probably save him a fortune when he visits China.
IS A TOTAL DISASTER. But the clause says "without the consent of Congress.". This venal GOP Congress will consent.
And one of them is for massage parlors?
@OfficeGovEthics @nytimes @washingtonpost TRUMP will cont. violating d constitution... Impeach him!
@davidcicilline @POTUS what will you do about this?
@Leticia17922167 @POTUS so what are you going to do?
Speak out. Not just on Twitter but on MSM please!
@NormEisen @POTUS. Yep...for an Escort Service..I wonder  if Flotus was planning on running it after #IMPEACHMENT

There needs to be a new movie made for The Donald: "Emoluments Men"...
No conflict here Aa?
THIS *MUST* STOP. WE THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE MONSTERS IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE!!! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
WELL THEN DO SOMETHING BESIDES TWEETING!!!!!
That will be a tough going legally. No proof he accepted any gift, but its a doozy to say the least.
Poor Senators trying to be ethical when the WH has made it perfectly clear they are immune from ethics
@Barkforlove1 @POTUS just how much is A trademark Worth #GrifterPOTUS
How about attorney's ? granted the title ESQ ? Should be barred from holding office!!
@davidcicilline @POTUS 38 Emoluments Clause VIOLATIONS. #TrumpChina #emoulmentsclause
Nice Try does not apply to copyright or trademarks. Besides it is to corp not person.
@princesskimcj @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff @jasoninthehouse Oversight anyone??
When will Trump & minions be held accountable????
impeach
Take the gloves off and bring balance back to govt.


WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS!? His blatant use of his position as POTUS is using our nation as his cash cow.
we should build a wall there! Oh wait....
then #ImpeachTrump 
#russiagate
he doesn't care, he's a bully. He's president    now. Why should he bother to respect the rule of law.
@joncoopertweets @POTUS @HouseOversight @GOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @OfficeGovEthics
Looks to me like they become the property of the people, no?  https://www.state.gov/s/cpr/c29447.htm …
Well, at least some1 came up w/an action that might qualify. Most leftist morons think U can impeach 4 not liking him.
What is the point if nothing is being done about it all.
Please for the love of all that is good and holy, do something about this.
Why isn't anything being done done about this? He's getting away with all of it.
@shireenkhan @POTUS  #Kleptocrat or #Kleptotwat?
@senwarren @senmarkey @senschumer @SenFranken @SenSanders Realize you need house to impeach but can't you do something?
the US president now runs whore houses in China. Isnt this just dandy???
Is Trump legally required to decline?
.@SenatorCardin This is so outrageous...when is this nightmare going to end? #Trump #EmolumentsClause  #Emoluments #Corruption
#DoSomething 
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
someone in chg do somethg abt DT violation EMOLUMENT CLAUSE
@NormEisen @POTUS #MAGA used for Joint Fundraising Agreements w/RNC @GOP & domain owned by Trump Org  & link on @WhiteHouse 
don't worry we're going to loan you our national treasure #ChristopherSteele he'll set the record straight
Republican are scared of Trump, because they will get their feelings hurt.
@leahmcelrath @POTUS pretty sure he has complete "consent" fr
@NormEisen @POTUS 1/25/16 Assignment missing from chain of title at Assignment Recordation Branch @uspto for only #MAGA marks
@joncoopertweets @POTUS soooo when are you drawing up articles of impeachment?
PAY for PLAY. PAY for PLAY! Trump corruption must be stopped.
Impeach.
@NormEisen @POTUS Why did Trump PERSONALLY OWN 114 TMs @uspto until assigned to DTTM Operations on 1/25/16, including #MAGA ?
Conspiracy theory: they hate him so much they want him to get impeached so flagrantly violated our laws.
@NormEisen @POTUS Why didn't Trump/Garten/McGahn disclose 100s of US/foreign TMs/licenses on OGE278E @OfficeGovEthics FRAUD!!
dictators like each other
@NormEisen @POTUS Why is #MAGA on @WhiteHouse  while Trump Org (Garten/Maron/Lysenko) defends Cancellation @uspto CONFLICT!!
@LyricalAve it cracks me up how Trump suprtr find these obscure news websites instead of normal news rest of wrld belvs in
Stop this!  Surely there are some govt officials watching the swamp
great so at what point instead of sharing does Congress and Senate actually seek charges?
Sen Cardin what are you going to do about @realDonaldTrump on this topic? @AGSchneiderman can help. Trump Corp incorp. In NY.
@SpryGuy @POTUS So why hasn't he been charged with a violation of this clause? Why is it all talk no action from the Dems?
There IS talk of action from the Dems. Unfortunately they control neither house of Congress. No power.
Tired of TALK of action! How many marches will it take b4 he is charged w/ violations agst oath of office?
who enacts the rules on emoluments?
China is trying to help us get rid of him. They don't like him either.
@GreenPeaches2 Isn't this @jasoninthehouse job to investigate trump's conflicts?
is complict in trumps wrong doings imo
For A business his sons allegedly R running (no 1 has seen the trust) & Trump still profits from! #TrumpConflicts
so what can YOU DO about it? We need more DOING!   Please! Earn that cushy health care plan you enjoy 
I genuinely enjoy having you as one of my senators. Thank you for all you do to represent my family and me!
Who will do anything about it?  Certainly not congress!
what is MD doing 2 protect Marylanders from corruption at this highest level. Clearly this does NOT benefit American citizens
Mr. Cardin what are the next steps to investigate this?
ok so what exactly do the people in power need from the American people (details please!) to impeach this guy!???
As a va nurse we couldn't accept money/we informed families frequently with cookies ok
.  @SenatorCardin WRONG! CHINA IS AN ALTERNATIVE DOMESTIC STATE! YOUR FACE IS A FOREIGN STATE. SAD!
This Admin thinks nothing of breaking the law or lying 2 the American people.Illegitimate potus =Illegitimate cabinet
@NormEisen @POTUS Now can we impeach SCROTUS' crooked ass?
With so many trademarks approved so fast, Emoluments Clause may be a far more peripheral concern. #ApplyPressure #resist
I don't think you can consider an approved patent application that he likely paid to submit a gift.
NO TRUMP NO PENCE IMPEACH HIM FOR EMOLUMENTS thanks @RepRaskin !
a clear violation
And?  With respect, sir, what are you (and the other honorable members) prepared to DO about it?
This nonsense is hilarious and hysterically desperate! Thanks for the laughs! 
@kals55 @POTUS He's in this for the $$. Take that trump supporters. Your lives are about to come apart. Except his richcronie
@baileelee @POTUS Trump is in a compromising position. We are doing our part by speaking out. Now what are you going to do?
The ACLU needs to file the complaint against trump. Let's get this moving and get him out office.
Impeach
WTF? Really? Just like rerouting planes from Mar-a-Lago and stupid helipad.. Spoiled know-nothing gets what he wants
What is with Congress,  Why aren't you folks doing something about this? Grow a spine.
Trademarks he's been trying to get for a decade and movement occurs only *after* his bid for the WH, but that's unrelated
How many conventions and statutes can he ignore before there is a tap on the shoulder?  No enforcement?
Congress needs to start impeachment process now! @POTUS
do something!!!!!!!
President is exempt from this
How does your ridiculous remarks on China help bring JOBS to Marylanders? Obama (a Jr. Senator) destroyed the DNC!
When will Ppl realize that becoming president was always about serving DT 's financial interests??
no one is surprised that @realDonaldTrump runs an escort service. Whore-mongering is his forte, right @SpeakerRyan ?
So here’s the thing. I appreciate you are pointing this out, but now you have to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
And who is involved in pay for play???
Mr Tramp is a foreign state.
INVESTIGATE!!!! PROSECUTE!!!! IMPEACH!!!!!
Should be valid forever
2/app.d the req. looking for quid pro quo. Any $ rec.d from China rec'd through trademarks violates Emolument clause.
1/Trump Org.'s req. for 38 trademarks from China violates conflict of interest agt. After yrs of denial, China
OK SO DOES THIS FINALLY MEAN HE'S "OFFICIALLY" BROKEN A DAMN RULE?
So, your point is.
Why is Congress not initiating impeachment proceedings? Stand for America, Senator. Please.
@PaulMichaelMalo @POTUS so when is he going to be charged??
why isn't congress doing anything about this? Have they chosen party over country?
You gonna do something about it? I sure hope so, especially since this includes escort services. @BeltwayPanda @POTUS
Now, if you can just get the House to impeach...
@profkeithdevlin There is a chance China being strategic here - doing this not to please #Trump, but to get him in troubles.
Please don't just point it out, Do Something About It!! That's why you're there.
@erikforCO @POTUS 
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP

He's also cashing in big at his Pay For Play at Mar-a-Lago. #EmolumentsClause
@WendyMarcinkie1 @SenatorCardin @POTUS 
To enable him to operate a string of whores across China from brothels masquerading as Massage Parls
you may be right!
have someone read the Constitution to you. Maybe kid's version without big words instead of vacationing every weekend
Any evidence that trademarks were in exchange for Trump change on "One China"?
hmmm..good question!  Timing?? Since Trump has tried for 30 years??
fuck us
so how does this get investigated?
HAHAHAHAAAA!! LOVE IT!
@memwilfong @POTUS OMG. How is this allowed to happen?  He's gonna be so rich when he's impeached.
Oh that silly old rag. Why you keep bringing that up?
As a proud Marylander, I ask you to please keep the pressure on him. This embarrassing fiasco has to end.
@CaptainsLog2017 @POTUS @chicagotribune @businessinsider @WSJ @washingtonpost @seattletimes @SciMarchSeattle @BBCWorld @Cnni
@CaptainsLog2017 Some of the 38 trademarks are for massage parlors and "escort services" by the way. Trump is a pimp.
it's clear what's not is who the hell enforces this LAW
@thehill #POTUS is a #PIMP #DelusionalDonald just what the fuck is this country coming to? The POTUS is a pimp!
@CaptainsLog2017 @POTUS When will impeachment begin!!!
Just #NO! Enough already! #Resign or sell all business interests. Not to your #kids!
Do NOT let @POTUS get away with this! Somebody has got to stop this man before he destroys any more of America's integrity!
@Barbiewithatude @POTUS well Senator, start that paperwork.
more conflict of interest   it's as if #45 thinks that the Office of the Pres is part of a marketing plan for his biz
REPUBLICANS SCREW U.S. CITIZENS to death! They don't care about AMERICA, We the PEOPLE!
so @SenatorCardin  et al. What now?
it is a blatant Chinese attempt to curry favor.  No one is falling for it, definitely not the President.
.@SenatorCardin I must've missed the part where Congress consented to China gifting @POTUS 38 TM's. When was that? @allanbrauer  #Emoluments
We already have over a dozen impeachable offenses - pretty cut & dry. Will be easy once GOP traitors step up.
#EmolumentsClause GET HIM and his Cronies out! #disgusting he's still even there!
#treason #invokethe25th #trumprussia
Can I come lie with you?
Okay. That came out ALL WRONG!!!! I meant "live". I'm a US refugee
and?  Is anything good to be done about it?  Or will we just keep saying he's in violation of it?
Well, he's always said he was going to be the first President to make it pay.
Guess we know what that's about now.
OK, what's the next step? Anything?
We know that Senator. What is the remedy? Talk is cheap. Actions scream loudly.
Looks like you have work to do, sir! We're counting on you!
Including escorts service and massage parlor
@xotrace @POTUS Will Congress or the DOJ do anything about it?
Dont count on #Sessions to do anything, low or no morals & involved w Russia too
again I ask. What are you going to do about it?
Get after it!!!!! Thank you for doing your job! #impeach
STOP HIM, please!
Maybe sessions has already decided there's nothing to see here and forgot to tell anybody. He forgets things...
You going to apply this to Hillary as well? ...
hey Trump supporters u do realize if u let Trump do this u can't trust him to bring back jobs right?
okay Senator, please start the process of impeachment.
THIS MATTER HAS BEEN OBSERVED+DONE BY THE ACTUAL GOVERNMENT IN ECUADOR.THE PRESENTS ARE SOLD AND GIVEN TO THE POOR!
@OfficeGovEthics  Why hasn't he been impeached yet?
Corrupt. What does China get in return?
I'd prefer a full fledged independent investigation. But our Congress is currently useless.
and the new tax cuts for rich includes insurance ceo's , so Donald plans his next tax free gig. @maddow
When will Trump have enough riches to go away? Can we just budget that in and set them free?
@Amplitude350Lee @POTUS So when the hell does something get done about these violations? No one is holding him accountable
@Amplitude350Lee @POTUS Do something!!!! Get his regime out of the White House. They are traitors and criminals.
@UreB31ngC0nn3d This treasonous POS has got to go!!
@joshtpm "Hey look guys, 50 days in office 400,000,000 dollars profit without leaving the country!" DJT
@Amplitude350Lee So please do something. I want him out by tomorrow close of business!
@rm1268 ...#ImpeachTrump !!!
@joshtpm @POTUS gee, and isn't Tillerson going there next?
@joshtpm @POTUS impeach already. America is in danger.
@Ali_H_Soufan @POTUS China granted 38 trademarks, knowing they would violate the emoluments clause? Interesting, huh?
@joshtpm @POTUS And you have vouched for the Deputy Att General that will not investigate the traitor at the White House
AND SOME OF THEM ARE FOR ESCORT SERVICES AND MASSAGE PARLORS.
This is very Gross. #PEUTUS IS A #PIMP #MassageParlors 
#ESCORTbusiness
