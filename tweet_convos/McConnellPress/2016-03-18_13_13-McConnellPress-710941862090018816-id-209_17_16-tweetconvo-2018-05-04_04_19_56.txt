@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu Palm Sunday? Really? "Crucify Him!! Crucify Him!!" Forgive them Father.....

@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu thank you for protecting us and not voting this judge garland in.
.@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu Remember when it's a Republican President they only act for THREE years.
.@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu Have you enjoyed being Majority Leader? Dust off your resume, you are out!
.@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu why didn't you just add "we will not confirm that Black man's nominee"
@senatemajldr I still believe that you & your fellow members of Congress should consider Mr.Garland for SCOTUS! Only fair! 'Nuff said!
@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @ThisWeekABC congress needs to do its job. If president nominated a jurist need to meet and hold hearings
@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu Hint/ Prez is not lame duck until The day after the November election
@SenateMajLdr @CNNSotu Solid interview, sir. With you.

@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu if republicans refuse to do their job we will see a continued rift in gop
@SenateMajLdr @FoxNewsSunday @CNNSotu "leader" McConnell, a president can't be a lame duck until after the November presidential elections.
@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu It's hard work, justifying ignoring your responsibilities.
@SenateMajLdr .  You are hijacking democracy.  Let the scotus be heard.  Don't disgrace America, coward.

@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu 
Refusing to give the American people a working government will not work.
@SenateMajLdr @meetthepress @FoxNewsSunday @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu
