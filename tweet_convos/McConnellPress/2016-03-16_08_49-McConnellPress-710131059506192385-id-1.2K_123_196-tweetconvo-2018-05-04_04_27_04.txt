@SenateMajLdr like our voice to repeal obamacare? You lied to get re-elected. Grow a pair & keep your word this time. Don't screw us again
@Jim65783 @SenateMajLdr The voice is the people who want to keep Obamacare and save lives. Democracy. I know you hate it, but tough.
@arembooks @SenateMajLdr I'd accept it if I wasn't lied to. Lost plan I liked & doctor of 25 years.  So it will go eventually
@Jim65783 @SenateMajLdr ...it's bad you lost a doctor you liked but many millions have cover that didn't have it before.
@arembooks @SenateMajLdr he was lying & people were going to lose their doctor their plan have to pay more. If he told the truth the
@Jim65783 @SenateMajLdr You do know that however many times you repeat the lie that Obama lied doesn't make your accusation true.
@arembooks @SenateMajLdr falling back on that democracy argument then. You believe Hillary isn't lying either I'm sure. I feel sorry for you
@Jim65783 @SenateMajLdr I don't need your sympathy. I believe the American people are bigger and better than fascist Trump and his goons.
@SenateMajLdr Why should we trust you, we did on repealing obamacare & you lied to us. Did you suddenly find some integrity?
@Jim65783 @SenateMajLdr Can't repeal without majority vote to override a veto. They've presented bills to repeal it but Potus vetoed them.
@JamesKentjr @SenateMajLdr they can defund, they made promises to get elected then backed off. Backed of amnesty too
@SenateMajLdr Well, here's what I have to say...
#scotushearing #MerrickGarland #WeNeedNine #DoYourJob
@RafiOmar83 @SenateMajLdr Good example - Kennedy SUCKS! #NoHearingNoVotes!
@TinaBogani @SenateMajLdr But he was given a hearing. Give Garland a hearing, & if the Senate think that he can't do the job, don't confirm.
@RafiOmar83 @SenateMajLdr Why waste the time? Let's spend our time looking at a feasible nominee. Betcha this POTUS can't come up w/ one....
@TinaBogani @SenateMajLdr If lead prosecutor of the Oklahoma City bombers is not feasible in your eyes, why not make a suggestion of ur own?
@RafiOmar83 @SenateMajLdr Nominee should fulfill these 5 criteria: http://tws.io/1TfksKf  We'll have to see who fits that bill.
@SenateMajLdr

Having our say, like your constituents?
@SenateMajLdr Yes they are and they have. Now #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr the American people should have a day by choosing to not pay you for your refusal to do your job #SCOTUSnominee #partisanhack
@SenateMajLdr the American people did have a say by electing @POTUS who did his job, now do yours #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr  for someone who promised Obama to be a one term Pres you are a sorry example of a leader. Don't obstruct congress old man!
@SenateMajLdr You just hold your ground. Libs will throw a hissing fit, but O'well. They've ran this country down enough.
@SenateMajLdr I didn't know that an elected @GOP rep was the proverbial "free check w/ no work" ya'll deride! I want my damn tax $'s back
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Not when that say is a Constitutional duty reserved to the executive!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress We HAVE and he one both elections, you schmuck!

@SenateMajLdr We already had our voice in the last presidential election. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr I did have my say, I voted in 2012 -- so do your job!
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Yes in 2012 when "the people" you think don't matter  elected the President.
@SenateMajLdr you, sir, are a traitor. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr SCOTUS appointments are done by the President & Senate !! It's part of your job description. Do your job per the Constitution
@SenateMajLdr the people are literally saying do SOMETHING
@SenateMajLdr Sir, the American elected President Obama twice.  We have spoken.  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr We HAVE spoken: The sitting President appoints #SCOTUSnominees and you wastes-of-flesh in the Senate advise & consent
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Why did we hold a presidential election in 2012? My voice doesn't count? #YouHeardOurVoiceIn2012
@SenateMajLdr   Why not apply this logic to the Republican Presidential Nominee and quit trying to thwart the will of the Trump voters.
@SenateMajLdr Our voice was heard when we re-elected President Obama. Are you listening Senator? Resing and stop wasting taxpayer money.
.@SenateMajLdr Obasturd and his minions SUK! Need we say more?
@SenateMajLdr I put my trust in the voice of @BarackObama and he still speaks for me. He speaks for all of us as POTUS. Put it to a vote.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs we are trying to make our voices heard. Stop trying to stop the man we are voting for....Trump
@SenateMajLdr you are full of it. You didn't say that about background check or minimum wage increase.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress The American Ppl spoke 8 years a go. Do not understimade the American ppl.Your time will come for reelection?
@SenateMajLdr I'm good with Garland. Thanks for asking. #ConfirmGarland
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress and I say DO YOUR JOB and hold hearings.  This is your best opportunity and you know it
@SenateMajLdr We had our say in 2012. We elected a President to fulfill his constitutional duties, now you need to do yours. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr We voiced who we wanted to pick SCOTUS nominees in 2012.
@SenateMajLdr I voted for Obama in 2012, does my voice not matter?
@SenateMajLdr I voted in 2012 THAT WAS MY VOICE. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr we voted @POTUS to office and he has a constitutional right to nominate even during an election year #DoYourJob @SCOTUSnom
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob You're the one depriving the people, who elected the President for a full four year term, of our voice.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress then get off your ass and vote against him
@SenateMajLdr As a representative government "our voice" is YOU, CONGRESS, the PRESIDENT. You swore to uphold the #Constitution. DO YOUR JOB
@SenateMajLdr We used our voices by re-electing Barack Obama.
@SenateMajLdr I had my say in 2008 and 2012, #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr You are no leader I would ever follow. #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Registered Rep for 33 yrs here, for God's sake, do hearings.Better choice than you'll get w Hillary
@SenateMajLdr We, the People, did vote for a choice, and his name his President Barack H. Obama, and he is doing his job. YOU are NOT.
@SenateMajLdr The people elected Pres. Obama til next January. When Alito was the nominee, the GOP (incl me!) wanted an up/down vote.
@SenateMajLdr they did.  They elected Barak Obama.  Do you job!
@SenateMajLdr Our voices already rang out loud and clear in 2012, and you are stifling our say by resisting Obama's nomination.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress My voice says to please do your job.
@SenateMajLdr We had a say in 2012. I didn't even agree with the outcome. But that's how our democracy works. #DoYourJob, you fucking turtle

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress The people already had their voice in 2012. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr The people should be able to withhold your pay for not obligating your duties as a Senator.
@SenateMajLdr The American people deserve a government that doesn't accept stagnation as the status quo. Do your job. Hold a hearing #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr Mitch the American people did have their say on the #SCOTUSnominee. We twice elected the guy that appoints judges. #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr My voice was heard in 2012.  And 2014. #ReadTheConstitution #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob as the Constitution mandates. The people had their say in 2012 when they re-elected @POTUS.
@SenateMajLdr as a republican I believe you and the senate are hurting the party by not going through the nomination process.
@SenateMajLdr end of GOP thanks to you: trump, #scotus

@SenateMajLdr We Voted in 2012, Stop denying our rights. You #DoNothingCongress   @POTUS

@SenateMajLdr Put your Hood on Mr. Wizard come out that closet, u and your red neck racist prty members will not steal Democracy
@SenateMajLdr Your party is a#calamity. #DoYourJob
@senatemajldr cause you control Senate you think your job is to subvert POTUS to gain increasing gop dominance of USA politics & economics
@SenateMajLdr We made our choice in 2012 election when we elected President Obama for 4 years, not 3 yrs. and 1 mo. Do your job or resign!

@SenateMajLdr Donald Trump said you're fired!
@SenateMajLdr resign punk
@SenateMajLdr let it have a vote punk, good for nothing, Mcconnell.  Your salary should be reduced to less than the minimum wage,
@SenateMajLdr and they did when they reelected President Obama. Your continuing inability to do your constitutional obligation is pathetic.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs the American people had their say. In November of '08 & '12! Obama by 5 million votes!
@SenateMajLdr We had an election and the people were heard. @POTUS did his job. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr And when GOP loses Presidential election? Do we pout and block noms for next 4 years? #preschool #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@Slickabrina @SenateMajLdr Probably not, as such obstructionism will probably mean the Democrats regain control of the Senate. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr They already did when they elected President Obama! 52% approval by  Gallup today!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress I agree, let's give them a voice, it's called a vote and the vote was cast ➤ @POTUS NOW ➡︎#doyourjobMitch⬅︎
@SenateMajLdr Thank You Sir!  The people have had enough and are letting our voices out LOUD AND CLEAR!
@SenateMajLdr   @BarackObama represents the American people's say on #SCOTUSnominee. That's why we elected him!  #DoYourJob #DitchMitch
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress they have been given a voice - if you are so scared of an African American then you should resign you racist
