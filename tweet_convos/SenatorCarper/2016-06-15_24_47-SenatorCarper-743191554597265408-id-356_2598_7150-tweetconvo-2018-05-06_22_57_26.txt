We want you to take the right action. Complete ban on assault rifles.  Nothing less. #enough
those laws already exist. You are referencing single shot rifles. Assault rifles are already banned
AR-15 is an assault rifle. One simple modification can turn it into a fully automatic weapon. @jasonindisney @thatgirlkelly @ChrisMurphyCT
an assault rifle is an automatic rifle that is battlefield ready.
there are already strict laws that prohibit modifying these rifles into automatic mode.
If laws won't stop a bad guy from getting a gun what makes you think it will stop them from the modification? @jasonindisney @thatgirlkelly
We should ban all assault rifles. @jasonindisney @thatgirlkelly
we already did back in the 80s. Do some reading. Don't act on emotion
pathetic appeal to pity, you are taking advantage of timing and misinformation to push your radical platform.
you can not get the guys away from the bad people this point, all you are doing is making us even more helpless.
A gun is an inanimate object, incapable of violence. @ChrisMurphyCT @Elizasoul80
Silly argument. Semi-auto weapons aren't nec. in our society; only 4 war. #guncontrolnow #noh8
They use automatic weapons in war. @Steve_Lambeth @ChrisMurphyCT @Elizasoul80
AWB was in effect for 5 yrs when Columbine happened.  How did that work out?
Yes sir, 100% support from me on your efforts...it's time to act!
I want the violence to end, too. Please put a stop to Islamic terrorists killing Americans!
#Enough
I left a message for Senator Orin Hatch supporting you.
thank you for being a Republican with a soul. And for showing Republicans do have compassion!
@SenatorCarper 
Thank you also.If only Pres Obama would have been listened to earlier.The 15hrs were a practice of good faith
@SenatorCarper No citizens want ISIS stopped from coming in...not gun control take care of the real problem
@Alyssa_Milano This was Terrorism, not simple gun violence.
@caitrionambalfe Long overdue that something should be done about gun control in the US!
bad guys will still get guns. Take the good guys guns away which will never happen and we are done. So naïve. Wow
No one is trying to take your guns. Just make it harder for criminals to get them. CTFD.
And we should trust you why? Do you trust the GOP on abortion?
people are also calling to stop corruption in government but I will see you do a shit about that
@maddow more than the guns themselves, high capacity magazines should be banned
@JAShopper all you have to do cast the blame where it REALLY lies! With YOUR Whitehouse administration & FBI! You let him go!
Thank you! It's about time the dems stood their ground! You're doing the right thing! #endthisnow
thank you for your dedication to this vital issue! #Enough #singleissuevoter
you know jack crap about reality aka the real world were where people protect themselves and loved ones with guns
"Never let a good crisis go to waste"
@Elizasoul80 Yeah lets hope , look at Australia's before and after the banning of guns .. It's the best example if its effect
Look at Paris. No 2nd Amendment, no NRA. 130 massacred
And how many years did YOU serve in the military, "Patriot?" #ChickenHawk @CoulsonJason @ChrisMurphyCT @Elizasoul80
give up your security first before you take mine.
@Alyssa_Milano You see this is what confuses me. I've bought a gun online and and there was a background check already
really how about showing this stat of  a majority oh and not one made up by bloomberg or shannon watts
Thank you Senator Murphy! I wish I could keep that floor with you!
sheep for the Wolves' taking, all of you
@Alyssa_Milano lol
Fixed it.
@NooneOfan As long as Congressional Repubs ignore the will of the people.....
@Alyssa_Milano Worth noting that every time Democrats make gun control an issue, they lose seats.
Most gun violence is committed w/handguns by men raised by single mothers @ChrisMurphyCT @Alyssa_Milano
There is common ground on this issue. The majority of Americans want us to take action to end gun violence. We can come together. #Enough
thank you for your voice
@Alyssa_Milano molon labe!!!!
Thank you @ChrisMurphyCT & all the others that stood with you. We have your back. Keep up the fight. #ENOUGH
There is common ground on this issue. The majority of Americans want us to take action to end gun violence. We can come together. #Enough
. World history proves you will NEVER end gun violence.
Men (and women) are violent without guns! Men kill men. Period.
@maddow simple. Have to do something when a wacko is in your office twice. Watchlist bozos don't get to buy guns.
@AndyRichter until congress are victims or profit there won't be a change
The majority of Germans in 1933 wanted Hitler to "do something" about "the Jewish problem." They were wrong too. #Misguided
@maddow thank you
I agree & way to do it is elected officials to quit fighting & work together for the American people who elected them.
@maddow A law will not end gun violence anymore than it ended  drug abuse.
@caitrionambalfe We need leaders who care about the people and not just their own power grabs and political gain.
Yes, the majority of Americans want to be able to protect themselves - the stricter the gun laws- the higher the death toll.
@maddow Stmnts like this prove #Dems can't think their way out of a paper bag, just gunning for votes, make me #Libertarian .
@maddow any gun control measure passed is treason and a violation of the US Constitution. #Treason
@maddow UPHOLD GUN RIGHTS
@maddow as long as there are ANY guns in the world...there will be gun violence. Wise up and stop being afraid.
@maddow I find it sad that Hillary's 'delete your account' tweet had 500.000 RTs in a few hours. 

This TW is so much more.

@maddow We are so proud of you, Senator Blumenthal and Senator Booker.  Still watching.  #Enough #holdthefloor
@maddow there is common ground among reasonable people. It's called the high ground.
You should show the promo video for the rifle used in Orlando on the senate floor
https://youtu.be/4Iwr6qJr6b8 
Yep, because ISIS attacked us, the Dems feel that it's necessary to take guns away from citizens.  #Enough
.@AspiringThrawn @ChrisMurphyCT making an islamic terrorist attack about a political (gun grabber) goal yet again.
you gonna take the guns from the secret service? Drom the military? #violenceisviolence whether with guns or knives.
Help @USMC kill more terrorists then. Thanks.
Thank you, Senator Murphy, for your leadership, your commitment, your courage!!!
@lsarsour referendum? Like the UK does. Lets see if its true that the US isn't mostly gun nuts and psychopaths.
my guns are to protect me and my family from #terrorist. #2ndAmendment
Lies. Americans stand by their precious Second Amendment rights. #molonlabe #2a #nra #tcot
so proud of Senators stand today on this issue. Wish my Senator @senrobportman wasn't spineless in  face of the NRA #Enough

@christinafreund No. What we're trying to do here is empower the @FBI to fight terrorism WITHOUT these political stunts.
banning assault rifles will not decrease the gun violence in cities like Chicago, NY, LA, or Miami by one death!
Keep up the great work. Standing behind you in the great state of Texas, even though our gutless senators here are NRA shills
how about you not do anything and end the Infringements on the 2nd amendment. #banassaultmuslims #2a #HandCuffHillary
@GinaGrad You're right, take action... arm yourselves, train, be prepared to defend yourselves, family and property. For sure
Proud that CT is taking the lead on this dire issue #HoldTheFloor #filibuster #Enough
Sadly, most of the GOP & a few Dems don't care what the people want. They are all beholden to the #NRA.
Actually, we wish you'd work with us on real solutions, instead of attacking rights. @ChrisMurphyCT
Shall not be infringed. How about keeping Terrorists out of the country? Were Luger firearms the problem in WW2 Europe??
@SenMarkey Thank you for taking a stand! #filibuster #holdthefloor #Enough
what "common ground" do you share with me sir? Common sense, common ground...lib speak for "no discussion" #enough
I guess everyone I know & myself is not included in that million.
thank you for your leadership! For Sandy Hook and all America, set the filibuster record to give this issue the spotlight
Nothing you have proposed will DO ANYTHING. Shut it and quit the posturing.
The majority of Americans also want term limits for all elected offices!
Thank you. We are with you.
@Mama3Cubs #BloodOnYourHandsGOP
Thank you!! #Enough #holdthefloor
Thank you for everything you are doing tonight. Thank you.
as usual you are wrong
thank you for taking a stand. We all have your back!
Senator Murphy keep the filibuster going. Great work
so happy you are brave enough to take this on #filibuster
Thank you!!!
thank you for leading the filibuster to demand common sense gun control! Proud to be a Democrat tonight!
@NevSchulman I'm so tired of people trying to take our guns. If the FBI would have done their job right he wouldn't get a gun
So what? There's common ground on ending abortion. On hate speech. We don't sacrifice civil liberties because morons want to
@NevSchulman how by taking our guns. Clean up the streets and then u get the guns that kill most people.
you the best!!! Keep going we are with you!
My students know about gun violence in Hunts Point Bronx. They write to @POTUS and legislators. Sadly, violence continues.
Gratitude to you and all @SenateDems for your courage to stand up to the #NRA #Enough #MakeItStop
Keep going!!!!  This fight is too important!  End gun violence-common sense background checks. Even 1 life is worth saving!
Thank you so much for being a hero. Something hard to come by in Washington DC
keep it up. Give 'em hell. #Enough

if you'd stop lying every time you talk on the topic, maybe someone would come to the table
You're my new hero
go as long as u can w/ fellow @SenateDems to bring a solution to gun control.  Watching from No. Texas @cspan @maddow
Thank you, Senator Murphy, for your focus & courage. It's time for Congress to step up.
nobody wants your liberal ideology ... it never saves lives only makes criminals safer and law abiding citizens less safe
You are not correct , you guys can't be trusted with this.  You're all emotional, and don't have your facts straight.
Thank you for leading this effort. Tired of excuses and prayers instead of action.
Thank you!  Keep going, we are with you!
I support your efforts Senator Murphy. #filibuster
There is no common ground when one side says it is their way or the highway. #ShallNotBeInfringed
And what would that be?
Thank you for your commitment! Bravo!
I wish you all the best.  You are right...  Enough is Enough  #Enough
Very proud to say you're my Senator. Thank you.
@KatrinaNation I really doubt they want you to use arbitrary lists. I don't.
No Fly List criteria are vague and it violates due process. Without fix, don't use it to restrict freedoms https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/until-no-fly-list-fixed-it-shouldnt-be-used-restrict-peoples-freedoms … via @ACLU
Thank you, Sen. Murphy. #Enough #NoFlyNoBuy #CommonSenseGunLaws
THANK YOU @ChrisMurphyCT! Keep up the great work! Breathe deep and KEEP GOING till there is real gun reform!
Then start following the immigration laws! demonrats do not!
Thank you, thank you, thank you. #Enough
.@ChrisMurphyCT Assault weapons are to the 2nd Amendment what child porn is to the 1st A. Exceptions can & should be made. #holdthefloor
F the NRA,WAKE UP AND REINSTATE THE BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.OH BTW GUESS OBAMA Isn´t going to TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS UH?MORONS!!
thank you!!!
thank you!!!!
JUST DO IT ALREADY. IT WAS FUCKING #ENOUGH AT SANDY HOOK. EVERYTHING AFTER IS ON US.
@sandyhook Finally someone who has common sense, keep fighting!! Enough is enough!! I support you!
I am not coming together with a person elected to protect us that wants a defenseless America by taking our guns!!!!!
thank you!
think again.  #makingupfacts 
I guess their just not going to mention on CNN the shooter was using an illegal weapon. That's the irony.
oh sorry, that is just info my mom just gave me but still only a tiny fraction of guns used in massacres
Thank you from Austin, TX!  #Enough
Address the violence, not the gun.  Ask the question why there are so MANY killers, though there are more lawful owners.
COUNT THESE LIVES!! IDIOT!
UR JUST THROWING A HISSY FIT AND NOT MAN ENOUGH TO GET OUTSIDE AND FIGHT FOR #AMERICANS!! #ENOUGH #NotOneMore
Go read the Constitution you dufus.  The bill of rights is not there for some whimsical change, we have a right to bear arms
Yes!!! #Enough @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez
how ? This guy had a gov. Contract job to carry/purchase guns. Also no criminal past. What would have gun control done ?
Thank you for standing up for us!
How do you propose to do that? Guns aren't violent, people are. What about violence, generally?
You're our hero.  Many of us have been screaming #ENOUGH since Columbine almost 20 years ago.  #gunsense #IStandWithChris
please don't make the no fly list the way we address gun violence. It needs to be abolished not expanded.
Thank you for refusing to stay silent!
Thank you Senator!  You make this CT resident proud!  Keep it up!
enforce the current laws first! Automatic weapons are already illegal to own w/o license & documents.
thank you Sen. Murphy!!
God bless you sir! Enormous thanks to you and all other dems who are taking a stand today!! #Enough
@Tara96613863 @HillaryClinton @puppymnkey 101 Dead thanks to the NRAs most popular murder machine
stay strong in this fight. You speak for so many #Enough #WeDemandAction
They were still able to get "Assault Weapons" while the regular citizens became sitting ducks.
France has strict gun laws too, but did that stop those terrorists from committing those acts?
Take away our rights to defend ourselves while letting in potential terrorists into the country, No problem.
I'm watching. Keep going.
Respect from Orlando
#CommonSense
grateful for what you're doing! Stay strong and don't back down. #filibuster
Repealing the Second Amendment might significantly curtail gun violence. A "scary-looking gun" ban won't. Take a real stand.
thank you thank you for actually doing something about the gun issue in our country. #EnoughGunViolence
@bulldoghill #DisarmHate
What happens if the Gov puts someone on the NFL mistakenly?
GUN violence? Why just gun violence?? How about ALL violence??
when are you gonna wake up ??? These laws your trying to pass do nothing to deter criminals !!
Full support from this #registeredrepublican #Enough you have my support
Thank you Senator Murphy! Don't back down.  The American people are tired of bearing witness to killing machines.
Yes this MUST STOP
Thank You Senator
You look foolish today.  Islamic terrorist killed those people not the gun.  Why more refugees? #IslamicTerror
