Did you welcome my multiple calls, voicemail & tweet this morning regarding the repeal of the ACA? Please vote no!
Thank you so so much for working hard for us. :)
By voting to take your healthcare away. You're happy with that, right?
He... literally said the opposite, but ok?
Hey kw, @shwey and I are on your side. We <3 your passion tho!
At any rate, thanks -- and make sure Heller understands what he did was wrong.
Thought you were talking about @dennisroy - think we all had our wires crossed :)

Either way, def not for Heller moving forward on MTP.
Thanks for having my back Shweta!
In other words, I'll take the gov. $ to help deflect from how terrible of a person I am
FEMA is socialism. ask Pruitt and Trump.
hey wheres "brownie"... you GOpBags loves thats GOV help when convenient.. but not when People need it LIAR UR OUT! SAD! lol
why should those without wildfire issues have to pay to fight wildfires for you folks?  it's like healthcare, every person for themselves.
So does that mean tRump has the staff for that or is he still running a skeleton crew in the WH?
I welcome 2018 where we will vote for anyone but your cowardly self. Sold Nevadans out for money and power.
Donating to @RosenforNevada at www.rosenfornevada to get this liar @SenDeanHeller out of office. 

NV deserves a senator with integrity.
Guess pressure from Trump turned you into a yesman! Shame! Trump wud turn on u in a drop of a dime. Already has! You're an embarrassment!
@SenJohnMcCain I am asking you as a breast cancer survivor who has young children to do right by us, the American people! Please do not just
You must vote for the right of the elderly, sick, mentally stabled, disable and the poor! Remember this please
And yet, your vote yesterday was an attempt to take away disaster relief otherwise know as healthcare from #Nevada.
#Nevada knows who to vote against in 2018. Did you not think voters were watching?
Be nice if you wanted #healthcare4all instead of #wealthcare4thefew. I hope #FEMA tells you to ask a billionaire to bail you out
voted YES to throw the stupidGOP voter off the bus.. BUT  now have their Type2 self-inflicted  blubber cond, saved BY DEMs #morons
What the fuck do you care about Douglas county? You must be getting something out of it if you're showing concern.
Pls stand strong against ACA REPEAL!  Badge of honor to get dissed by @POTUS.
While u vote to gut fema funding.  What a hypocrite.  Do ur constituents get that?
No one in charge of FEMA, @SenDeanHeller  If GOP can say there's no climate change & dismantle EPA, I can say there were no wildfires in NV
Unworkable my butt......none of you even tried!   It has to do with Obama so you want to get rid of it. Your all childish and ridiculous!
Reminder: what communication industry paid"don't boo"in'16 to sell your internet privacy:
Heller,D
Repub.
NV
$78,950
Nope....big government. You are against that. Refuse FEMA help
Wow, Sen Heller...after #45 called u out @ luncheon...we felt u would hold the line for ur Gov & ur constituents & stop this nightmare.
Looks like you are a disaster for this country and for Nevada ... how much money did you take to screw us all?

Thanks for the link!

Bipartisan governors write to @SenateMajLdr & @SenSchumer urging the Senate to reject "skinny" repeal bill.  
Wildfires burning hotter, longer with global warming.  @fightdenial @ClimateDesk
2018  the Senator's work for the people not for the president
We will soon need fema for basic healthcare if you continue to side with Trump instead of NV.
But Douglas country won't recover from ACA repeal brought to them by cowards like you.  Heller opponents look at
GOP was bribed/threatened. Heller #Nevada was a no until billionaire Steve Wynn called him every day
Trump threatens
You're vote today could possibly be the biggest
mistake and decision you've ever made 
Jacky Rosen for Senate!
You have lost my vote and my respect. You lied to the people of Nevada and you will not return to DC. May your conscience damn you.
Why worry about saving people from fire damage when you are perfectly happy with letting Cancer take them?
"I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans
Let's hope FEMA cares more than you do for healthcare
Oh, Mr. Heller. Don't change the subject. Stand up for your state's health!
#sleazy Your vote today was spineless and lacked moral courage. #DeanHeller
I hope this doesn't have anything to do with the ACA and how you have voted.
Thanks for voting against Nevadan's best interest!
Why should I pay taxes that don't impact me to help people in NV after a wildfire? They chose to live there & need to take responsibility!
the government should help people you think they should help. But not with healthcare?
SHAME ON YOU!!!
Hopefully you'll be able to bear witness to the carnage you cowards have unleashed on the country you allegedly love so much. Kiss off.
Vote NO on  #HealthcareBill Do what's right. Please 
The Senator is a lier
Like seriously, as if you give a crap about Nevada. Trump owns you, and Trump...well, it looks like Russia owns him
Your disaster is healthcare and you sold us out.
NO on Trumpcare!!
I can't believe you gave a yes vote. Sell out to big money
Will you stab Governor Sandoval in the back and strip healthcare for NV residents? @GovSandoval @DeanHeller
Will FEMA help with the disaster you are creating by voting to repeal ACA? #ResistTrumpcare

Heller was a no until billionaire casino magnate Steve Wynn threatened him almost daily. What a sad, perfect example of money in politics.
As a Nevadan, please vote no on repealing the ACA. It would hurt many people in Nevada.
You're doing a great job! Please vote YES to repeal & replace Obamacare!
I welcome 2018 when your constituents will vote you out of office.

Coward.

Healthcare: vote NO. Do what you know is right. This is too important to throw away your precious vote.
Please vote NO today don't let the people of Nevada down, you answer to us NOT drump!!!!

If GOP votes to proceed to a bill w/ no text, no hearings, no CBO score, no clarity on Byrd rule, they deserve the fiasco they're inviting.
Trump's approval 39% HC bill 17%. Don't hitch your wagon to this disastrous combo. Trump won't hesitate to screw you over either way u vote.
Please vote No. #SaveACA My brother is disabled and on Medicaid along with 70% of the people in the nursing home he lives in. #SaveMedicaid
