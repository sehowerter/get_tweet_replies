Why not expand a modified version of Obamacare to all americans. Eliminate traditional employer plans to fund it?
The additional finances taken in would fund it and enable improving the plan to reduce out of pocket expenses and premiums.
Actually that will be your presidency
Got that right.  It's now the More Unaffordable Trump Don't Care Act.
Lord I hope so that thing is a mess.. appreciate all that you do by the way truckers should be aloud to stay on paper logs not this electronics
This tweet aged poorly
@mgraves66 Who are all of these nobodies with verified twitter accounts?!
@UBS bravo

Seems to be a fly in the ointment.
So will healthcare if thats the case! And so wil life for millions!
I will never call you my president EVER!!!!
How is this something to boast about?  Do you have a business interest in coffins?  If not, you should. I'll be needing one
enjoy your tax break at the cost of thousands of lives. Murderer.
ty
.@realDonaldTrump
and leaving millions of Americans without coverage. How can you sleep at night?
Your main goal was to wipe Obama's name off of the history books at any cost, even if it meant American lives...racist!
how do you like it Donald..lock him up!!!
Thank you PE Trump...the dems forget about the millions that can't afford coverage now
If you want to continue the love fest with your fans you'd better REPLACE the ACA with something better and cheaper NOW.
It will consider refugees Syria and the whole world issues either it's only election propaganda
The real reason Rs hate Obamacare is that it costs them $300 bn/yr in taxes. They don't want to pay.
they voted against everything you said you would keep. MAGA?
yes, and we'll all remember to blame you and #GOP in two years.
Obama's legacy will be gone soon
Oh yes that's true but will you keep your promise to the 20 million people to keep specific needs around; DJT!
yea...so Americans will just go uninsured!! GREAT IDEA!! 
glad to hear u will quickly b replacing ACA with cheaper, better insurance for all Americans in need
@SenateMajLdr Sirs, 20 million Americans can't wait to see what you replace it with. Literally. #DonaldTrump #Obamacare
Thank goodness!

And you're about to take health insurance away from 20 million Americans! Keep digging that hole PEOTUS.
Stories like this one will be tragically different w/o viable replacement.
the senate voted against the pre-existing conditions provision from the Affordable Care Act.
Even though you said you wanted to keep that provision. So what's really going on?
We can never trust what @realDonaldTrump SAYS. Look at what he DOES. He's a chameleon. #ZeroSubstance
@jaketapper @nhdogmom @jheil @TeamCavuto do you know how many lives have been saved by Obamacare? Do you care?
And too many people will lose their health insurance, and have no way to go to the doctor! #MakeAmericaSickAgain
WHY?WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO U IN UR IVORY TOWER THAT WE B UNINSURED?Without no pre-ex cond I wld still b in bed with bad hip
my wish is you'd soon be history
you're ruining America and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Infant. Don't you get tired of embarrassing America? Doesn't it get old? Your dad would be so ashamed of your immaturity.
meanwhile in the U.K. Mrs May is forcing GP's to stay open 7 days a week 8-8. While millions will be ending up in graves.
Congratulations. People will die and that's on you.
A large portion of your base relies on this act. Lose their support & you have nothing.
all of you are disgraceful!
I'm sorry but you brought this whole ugly climate--it sucks but it started w/you. You, & what might also be history...
You are selfish & above all completely ignorant to the realities/struggle that every day Americans face. Now u want to take away healthcare.

TOTALLY.  GOOD ONE. 🖒
who benefits from taking healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans? 

The wealthy:
If the ACA is repealed, the wealthiest 400 families would receive a tax cut worth an average of $7 million each. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-tax-cut-400-richest-american-households_us_5876e523e4b05b7a465dd4ee?section=us_politics …
who is going to lose healthcare
just one example of someone ALIVE today because of the ACA (via @SpeakerRyan Town Hall):
The bad optics that began Paul Ryan's town hall: Ex-Reagan campaign worker thanks Obamacare for saving his life. 
.@realDonaldTrump So glad you're already scoring political points, sweetie, but do you have a new healthcare plan for the sick people?
Honey, once you get a real man you will get healthcare. Then you can get back in the kitchen making sandwiches.
Amazing! @shnikies78 just tweeted from the 1800's.
No its more like the 1950's led by the USA's greatest generation. Now its just a bunch of babies with their hand out
Fact: most "hand outs" are to the red states.
Wrong!
I don't trust anything a cult member puts on twitter. I know it's a fact
Oh so you cant even review the chart. I'm glad you know what you don't actually know.
.@realDonaldTrump so will a lot of people unless you have a better alternative in mind. Criticism's easy. Creative problem solving isn't.
.@realDonaldTrump complaints, as I tell my 12 year old daughters, aren't a solution. Plan please? Or is that another empty folder.
the plan is to let people buy and shop for their own insurance. Called being an adult.
Umm...that is what the ACA does. People can choose different plans.
In some states,you have only one choice  so your statement is false and to high
Which state forces you to have one choice? 
NC has only one company now for AC. BCBS..
Wow! Sorry, but you should be upset with the greedy insurance companies, not ACA
Woot! 30 million people about to lose their health insurance! Glad you find that good news.
more than that lost it when this can in effect. Think before you post
NEW POLL: Just 18 percent of voters want #ObamaCare to be fully repealed http://hill.cm/QW7buCa  ”
thanks to obamacare I could no longer afford health insurance! Rates tripled!
#Obamacare is saving lives! http://go.shr.lc/2hu3IQP  - @washtimes
guns also save lives but you want to take that away!
never guns saved lives,
my gun saved me from getting robbed and possibly saved my life.
that could be true for your specific case but generally it is not the case for all
it's true for many cases! Come on! Wake up!
and 11 MILLION Americans will no longer have access to healthcare. Who the fuck do you think you are?!
I would never deny you healthcare how could you deny millions?
Saying that to people who need health insurance SHOWS U do NOT belong as President. Just resign an go away
I hope you have self employed people in mind. Don't qualify for help and can't afford the $950 a month so I'm uninsured.
keep dreaming!!!!!
Of all the mistakes your parents made, you take the cake!
All the branches fell off your family tree when you were born
Not soon enough! With "coverage"  4 medicines would cost me over 2,000.00. I chose not to fill them.
competition will bring the prices down to make them really affordable. no more special interests monopoly on health care
please don't take our medicare away. It's bad enough Obozo hasn't given us a cost of living raise in our Social Security.
The Affordable Care Act was a great step for uninsured Americans. I would like the chance to do even better!
do a healthcare for all and your place in history will be assured.
That's the truth. The only initiatives that'd be better is single payer healthcare or universal healthcare @cwright16711 @realDonaldTrump
@HyperSentinel2 my taxes thank you
Here's 20 cents, call all your friends and give me back the change.
I’ve been called worse by better.
I trust you, and appreciate all that you will do for all Americans.
Please hurry
you and the white, racist Republicans only want to undo ACA because it was finished by a black man
@mike_pence @SenTedCruz Thank you for being emphatically CLEAR & DETERMINED to repeal Obamacare!!
good I'm tired of paying for my healthcare and 10 more people too!
And in it's place? Or this your way of getting rid of the tired and the poor?
.@realDonaldTrump
not really..Repubs using same bill
U promised 
'REPEAL & REPLACE
NOT
TINKER AROUND THE EDGES!
#FreeMarket
#FreedomCaucus
@POTUS How will you help those like myself denied coverage because #preexistingcondition #rheumatoidarthritis #TAR #SSDI
I'd like to see things from your point of view but I can't get my head that far up my ass
#LiarinChief is doing exactly the opposite of what he said he would do (except taking away healthcare from Americans)
- this better not affect me negatively. Life is hard enough these days!
as a parent of a teen with life long illness can you please explain how you will handle pre-existing conditions? #Scared
waiting for an answer
As will you!!!
Hopefully we will soon be able to say the same about YOU.
Make healthcare a RIGHT not a Privilege!!!
Wooo Hooo.Maybe something "Affordable " with some actual coverage.   Thank you.  #WomenForTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
We're going to have insurance for everybody. Health care for everyone. Look to Belgium, talk to the people there.
Loving.@realDonaldTrump,I'm 1 of many million#WomenForTrump#BabesForTrump#TrumpTrain#Trump2016
The zoo called. They’re wondering how you got out of your cage?
Yes - and will be replaced by TrumpCare. It will be like ObamaCare, but with Trump in the name instead of Obama!
I'm glad the affordable health care act will be history along with Obama! There is nothing affordable about it.
Thank God you have SNL to finally figured out ACA and ObamaCare are the same. Just checking, what about ACA don't you like?
You told American people that you would have a better one and then you want to take Obama care away and you have nothing
What's the difference between you and a brick? The brick gets laid.
shame the ACA will be gone and the millions who depend on it to stay alive, like my friend. Will you pay for brain surgery?
and you're replacing it with...what????
Oooooooh Thank You Sir! Thank You Thank You Thank You...
we are all very excited about your promised insurance mandate.
Hopefully, you too!!!!
Your rich cronies are laughing all the way to the bank while millions go without healthcare. #notsomethingtobeproudof
You have to be a sick, evil person to take pleasure in stripping millions of Americans of their much-needed health care.
It's wrong.  I pay over $500 a month now for health care that doesn't cover anything but office visits and medicine.
d #HolySpirit gave me a Revelation on d #ACA like what JESUS says n verse 49 of John 6-->https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:49&version=AMPC … #ACA #dies
Which is the exact opposite of what you said on the campaign trail F*ckface von Clownstick!
please cancel HB720 with Obamacare. It's killing our business
and you have no plan in place to replace it.  SAD!!
As a German I would take you to court if you tried to take away my health insurance.
How will the 20 million Americans dependent on it get medical care??????????
why would you wanna take something that has work"I have the afforable care act and I pay $28.09 for premiums"$5 doc visit
FULL repeal, free market solution! Not this crap Ryan put out toda
Yippee ki-yay! :)
So will you.
Thanks for nothing! I have Obama Care and love it.  Without it I'd have no insurance.  This country is going backwards not forwards!
Thanks Mr. Trump
Shame! There's no replacement #ACA & we don't want to/can't afford to lose it! Just fix what @marcorubio did w/Risk Corridor Payments! #MAGA
Is that your face? Or did your neck just throw up?
That should make you real popular, as support for the Affordable Care Act is @ the highest level EVER. @mike_pence
Go back to Moscow, Pee-Boy!! 
When you say "insurance for everyone" you do realize that means Single Payer Health Care?
@JerryFalwellJr what is you guys stance on HB2 in NC?
I am counting on you!

So, not only do I have to pay my kids tuition, now they won't have health insurance. What a jerk you are !!!
It's truly amazing what this man can accomplish with 140 character flaws
Repeal and replace would be like a load of passengers changing planes in mild-air over the pacific. Sound ridiculous??  IT IS!!!!
I said it once and I'll say it again llcoble34
yes yes yes DT
You've put right wing illegitimate nuts to run our country-Talento & Price have been are on QUACKLIST-what is wrong w/you
The money is in the medicine not the cure
"We're going to have insurance for everybody", Donald J. Trump. #shortfingeredvulgarian
Can you pay for my mothers medical bills then otherwise she'll be living on a bed in the street
HIP Plus is for Medically Frail & 100% is free including medicine I need to live. Do U Care? ACA #1
Who cares, is that all you have to ride on to keep your less than popular self going. Wow!
Go Trump! Worked in doc ofc.  2 baby bumps came in, new in system, did not have SS# (illegal), on Medicaid.  I paying $787 premium.I'm legal
But Congress shld not be passing the enormous, excessive Bill they call a budget.  They are robbing hard working Americans
better have a better plan then. Let's see what more affordable, better healthcare you can come up with.
most times it is we have to say yes to food and not to the medication we need to breath.
and what's your plan?
.@realDonaldTrump And this is going to be the reaction all over. http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/15/rep_mike_coffman_sneaks_out_of_event_early_as_constituents_ask_about_aca.html …
it saved my life... You have NO plan.  How many of us will you kill to make you and your friends rich?
I challenge you to create something better that helps the people.  It's easy to destroy but the real power is in creation
Thank you!!!
Your mum's like a switch, even a two-year old can turn her on.
@1catherinesiena  unaffordable no-care act you mean.  Very high deductible for unaffordable premium
71 yrs old and tweeting.  Crazy ass world.
