That's right dt fire No Legs Mitch so he can rat you out!
When is the orange moron going to realize McConnell works for us not him?
McConnell must step up or step down. Congress is not the private sector w sr exec perks. Support Trump!
Looks like @realDonaldTrump might have exaggerated his support for #MitchMcConnell.  He RT'd this @FoxNews tweet in August.
Ditch Mitch!!!  He's meddling in elections to help R. I. N. O. 's!!!

Absolutely agent orange should step down. You should run before we execute you for treason.
McConnell is incompetent!  He should be working!  Had 7 yrs to do this!  Time is up Mitch for you Mitch !  Take Graham Ryan and Mccain too
Anyway you're GREAT in firing. You can BRAG about that!!
Fucking GOP... like Lord Of The Flies... fun to watch!!
Maybe Trump & McConnell can step down together. That would be a great improvement!
Buffoonery at its finest, America is in a world of trouble thanks to Donald J Trump...
Lawyers are paid on the process... Trump gets paid for results. These lawyer politicians are perplexed by trumps drive for results
@realDonaldTrump The Biggest #Loser In History Has 2 Get His DICK MASSAGED Frm #FakeNews @foxandfriends  2 make lil donnie feel better 
It is obvious Fox is the administration's preferred station for propaganda.
Same old Trump - any success is because of him and him alone, any failure is due to everybody else.
Anyone else notice all his retweets are about himself?  Do you ever think of anyone else but yourself?

#DumbTrump's propaganda machine is running again on #FauxNews
You're an embarrassment. You know the GOP is plotting your downfall. Only time before they challenge your fitness as president. #Unfit
This is sooooo going to come back to bite him in the ass.
Retweeting fox news is all you got Donald #pleasestoptweeting #pleasestoplyingtousyouGiantAssHat
Yes, Trump should step down. He's unfit for office. #25thAmendmentNow #ButHisEmails
If it were me I would be taking him to court over things he has said to discriminate him
Stop with the douchebaggery. Waging war on Twitter is for 14 year old girls. Stick to golf and let others handle grown folk business.
He hates OBAMA for all the wrong he did the American people. Any one with common sense knows this.which leaves u out.
Oh good one! And he is reacting by flooding the swamp, tweeting like a prebuscent girl, vacationing more than any President and waging war.
Really Obama played golf and went on date night basketball games 2 to 3 vacation . Trump works thru the Weekend.
Say again?
I almost wouldn't care if he did something the balance of those days but I think in that time he plans his next golf outing and tweets
He could golf 5 days a week and still do 20 times more than OBAMA did in 8 years what president Trump has done in 6 months.
Funny!
Why does hatred for Obama/Hillary equal to love for this dope?
One thing he did was convince people to vote for a degenerate conman.
Yes, Trump SHOULD step down, and should've a long time ago.
If Reps worked with Dems worked with Trump then everybody could get some work done.
"McConnell Replies With A Yawn"
So why not fire EVERYBODY, but Trump first!
Your next! Step down now! Resign
McConnell is part of the swamp ! !!
Dumb that the question was even asked; McConnell doesn't serve at behest of POTUS & POTUS has no authority to remove him.
.@realDonaldTrump Stop Bullying everyone. Even if I agree McConnel needs to retire!
Do you understand our democracy at all....three equal branches of government designed to check and balance each other. YOU ARE NOT PUTIN!
#AmericaFirst rally at the southern border with President Trump laying the first brick on the wall!


Why don't you just get a job bahahahaha
Snowflake Probably Needs A Hug..
@realDonaldTrump If the average American had the same results that Mitch does they would be looking for a new job.
If the average American applied to be CEO of a fortune 500 company with NO experience, they'd be laughed out of the building. Sooo...WTF?
Unless his name was Barack Hussein Obama then he would be made president! What a mistake! #CommunityOrganizerinChief
Trump is a horrible leader that's why a lot of his business went into bankruptcy.  He can't even hold his cabinet together. #WORSTLEADEREVER
#ReplaceMcConnell like they did with Boehner
Why are you retweeting a news report saying what you recklessly (again) tweeted twice yesterday? #TweetLessSmileMore
@SenateMajLdr funded Obamacare @potus for $2 pork deal with @barackobama
#COWARDPOTUS

Senators don;t work for Trump! They work for the people! He can ask all he wants, but he won't step down! Learn Civics please!

International Trump haters be like...

#IamTrumpsupporter! Support him cuz he ACTUALLY cares about this country. Unlike BO & HC fans cuz of color or gender! #WhosHeadIsInTheSand?
Oh, a bot. How strange
Nope not a bot, just someone that can see America is getting "Trumped" ... I love USA but sorry your President is a danger to USA
Guess what?! Thank god most of America are not as close minded as you, but that's what Trump promotes.. total ignorance and hate..

So even tweeting yourself is too much work for you now? Just retweeting the bs that Fox tweets that sets your "policy" anyway?

I'd rather listen to no news than Fox. It's been shown that those who don't watch news are more informed than Fox watchers.
For normal, intelligent people it is usual to allow someone to answer a point rather than answering for them. Poor little confused Trumpkin
Sure thing Reagan, I love data!

Trump really has no idea how the three co-equal branches of the federal government work. McConnell is not his employee that he can fire.
He understands incompetence as practiced by you and McConnell and it impedes progress.
BOTH should "step down": MCCONNELL AND..., (August 11, 2017; 4:20 EDT) #DONALDTRUMP #FAIL
The constitution created separate presidency and congress : @SenateGOP should start acting like they know that.
Unfortunately President Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are "slow walking" your agenda, to the detriment of the American public!
Need to play hardball with RINOs in Congress.  They need to know that you&GOP will pull supporting funds for future re-elections from them.
CRTV freebie on Mitch McConnell:
#DitchMitch
Dump McConnell.
Mr. President, McConnell is the swamp
The "swamp" hard at working on not working. Repeal and Replace every one of them, more DIVISIVENESS. They are a disgrace to our nation.
I hate McConnell. But he'll take down Donald if he has to. And I'll love watching it.
Mr. President We cant afford to lose one Senate vote. ONE VOTE!
Fox Networks. Criminal Communist Cult Communications Channel. Anti-American Traitors!
I
What a hypocrite!! He doesn't do HIS job but he expects everyone else to bow down to his demands!! How can the republican party support him?
Bullying people aint healthly. Or good role model for baronand other kids

HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYONE DOING THEIR JOB WHEN YOU DONT DO YOURS ALL YOU DO IS PLAY GOLF ON OUR MONEY NOT YOURS #IMPEACHFASTPLEASE
Todays reminder that @FOXNews is the Trump News Channel. A PROPAGANDA unit for Trump. Making up stories to DIVERT ATTENTION from RUSSIAGATE.
Get it done or step aside. No time for BS with Trump.
Trumpy keeps running his mouth and he'll get nothing done at all! Oh wait, he has already gotten nothing done!! My bad.
#ditchmitch!! #repeala dreplace!
Too many weak Republicans. It does not matter.

He works for the people not Trump...Trump is second
I guess it's the American people that had expectations that were too high. We thought 7 1/2 yrs. would be plenty of time to repeal/replace.
Yeah yeah, we get it...no one is safe around you.

Great work! Keep pummeling @SenateMajLdr McConnell! 
We Dems love every second.
Get it done or move on McConnell.
Ha ha...Seanie why don't you 'splain to Dimwit  Mc Moneylaundering that he doesn't control the Senate!
Yes, Trump should step down.
McConnell: YOU R FIRED!!!!
Do you understand that you have NO CONTROL over Mitch McConnell. This is not 'The Apprentice' NUMBSKULL.

they'd get things done. Pres Trump's use to performance to get results not excuses. Send them back to private sector
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And our 'president ' forgets once again he is NOT a monarch.#WorstPresidentEver
In the Obama era, the daily show continues to criticize and satirize McConnell like a turtles in his incompetent nature.
He needs to go... Support our President or get over it!!!!!!!!!
fake news
Trump apparently dosen't understand the seperation of powers in our government.
@realDonaldTrump just like Black Widows.
Mitch McConnell is part of the Washington swamp Trump was talking about. He must go and take McCain with him
Trump needs to step down. He has no clue how democracy works
 Retweeting Fox & Friends? As if anyone takes their alternative facts aka/fake news, seriously.

He was up early this morning.

Your the next one on the list to get . Fired!!!!!
I don't think Sen. McConnell is going to last much longer, he is looking frail".
Pretend your teying to obtain a permit from him!
God gives us 9 characteristics of Antichrist in Daniel 7. "a little kingdom somewhere in Western Europe" #DJT Mom from Scotland.
Step down Mitch
Well.pray in God we Trust
They need to keep their word or else we are going to throw the bums out!!! #draintheswamp #maga @realDonaldTrump
#ditchMitch
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I agree with President Trump, it is the Majority Leader's job to get the republican votes.
YES... @realDonaldTrump should step down!
McConnell's book: 
"How LONG can I GAME Stupid American Voters?"  
He needs to GO!
Door open?  Throw his lame ass out the door.
They lost track of their antecedent:"Trump" is the subject of the sentence.

So I LOVE the ambiguity: YES! Trump ("he") *SHOULD* step down.
So now he is going to try to stack the deck with a new rep senator by moving wva to new position  to Take obamacare away from citizens Evil
Agreed, Trump should step down.  How's Melania's cyber bullying campaign going by the way?
Step down? How about just resigning!
McConnell must be drained #DrainTheSewer - plus all #neocons and  's #Globalists like #McMasters too! 
Potus,force him to step down
#DitchMitch
Who are you going to bully next, you are running out of people, especially the ones who give a shit.
Trump shakes hand with another nazi
Warning shot from his micropenis?  Pew pew pew. XD

McConnell doesn't care whether Trump thinks he should resign.  Many of us think Trump should resign.  It will make our country safer.
Please make our dreams come true. #Stepdown @SenateMajLdr  you're and evil #Turtle 
#DitchMitch 
#StandWithTrump
Bullying at its finest!
The GOP sides & stands behind McConnell! This latest Trump-ism is an unproductive distraction! #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia #FireHannity
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
whopping 69% of Americans want Congress and Trump to work on fixing the ACA rather than repealing and replacing it. So who should step down?

Who would take his place?
The Establishment,Progressive Script: 
1.Pretend to work, while doing nothing.
2. Blame @POTUS 
3. Keep Obamacare W/'bipartisan support
I vote yes
Maybe Trump should step down. Everybody would be able to breath easier.  We wouldn't have to put up with his bullying.
Keep shitting on everyone.  Come impeachment time it will be that much easier for them to cast their votes.  And sooo much more satisfying
If M. M. had his act together ALREADY better things would've happened. He needs to retire. He's a prime example of 'dilatory senators'

Trump shows his incompetence & lack of understanding of governance yet again
Conservatives are demanding McConnell step down, as well as many others, Lindsey Graham, McCain, & Paul Ryan to start.
Love watching you lose all support. It will make the impeachment hearings so much sweeter.
Better do something quick....
RHINO's need to go, they are damaging America just as much if not more than liberals! They are deep state, undercover turncoats!
trump is really good at blaming other people but really bad at accepting responsibility. As head of the party who is responsible?
@realDonaldTrump the next day after they pass obamacare. All of Washington voted to exempt themselves from the new law.
McConnell is not the problem!  Trump is!!!!
https://www.gofundme.com/x248zek 
Good Riddance

I know you believe in giving people a chance Mr. President, but McConnell has let you down and failed you. Time he hears "You're fired"
Where is your chin @realDonaldTrump
Stop asking for emails when we want to comment, already over swamp with emails of all kinds, u r able to delete comment if u don't like it !
You bully McConnell but have generated NO policy. You are deranged.
#25thAmendmentNow  #TrumpShouldResign
3rd straight fox and friends retweet. Sad!
Senator McConnell: there should be no division in our party. Please start leading the party in entirety behind our president. Leaders LEAD!
