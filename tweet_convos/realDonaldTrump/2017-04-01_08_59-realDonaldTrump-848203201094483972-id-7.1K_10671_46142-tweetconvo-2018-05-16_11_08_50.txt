About time these clowns get something right.
So how will Trump Administration help ins vendors stay/expand into those markets?
As long as there is money nobody is losing nothing now get off Twitter
So you're saying where there is no medical insurance offered, there is no way to get medical insurance?  Profound. Maybe an expansion?
So happy you were able to solve that problem. Keep up the good "work".
Daddy
So Putin didn't just help you beat Hillary- he also helped you get the nomination. http://www.newsweek.com/russia-investigation-trump-election-primary-marco-rubio-576850 … #illegitimate
WHO HELPED HILLARY BEAT BERNIE SANDERS???
So failing and sleepy eyes means award winning journalism...GOT IT!
Duh
The failing president still doesn't get much of anything
You're a failing so-called President. Shut the fuck up.
#fakenews @nytimes and @CNN
And other fruit media Brainwashed you Grabinski .
Lier
The only things failing are capitalism and you. Both need to go.
Our children are seeing this behavior. You should do better by them. It's the little things.....
whyis this guy so weirdly insecure abt the nyt like stop spending all your time talking about them actually run the country
There is a way forward, single payer. If you want to leave a positive legacy instead of a pathetic mess, do something humane.
Let them a good dose of Americans without, the fault of dems and Soros republicans
MEDICARE FOR EVERYONE!!
It is long past time that the NYT sue you for slander!
You are not protected when acting outside your job as SO-CALLED president!
Oh the joys of being POTUS TRUMP...I get to tweet bs, golf @ Mara Lago while criticizing everyone else.
Enemy of the people eh 
YAAAHH!  #MAGA 
ACA will fail--let it. Otherwise there is no "leverage" for negotiation. Unfortunately in business we used to say "Make it hurt"
174 million will have HC via employer.  Those affected are those who normally vote Dem. The Dems will have to come to the table in my view
All that wasted paper & ink....lol
PLEASE ADHERE TO UR OWN WORDS U TRAITOROUS LYING ANTIAMERICAN 
&
RELEASE UR TAXES!
STOP WINNING DONNY!!!! WE CANT TAKE ALL WINNING YOU KEEP DOING.... YOU BIG LOSER AND FAILURE. #AmericaFirst
Your failing and the new york times is not. Please resign and help save the world.. Garbage
Keep up the faith these liberal crybabies still can't get over their loss of the presidency. Keep up the good work
You need to learn to handle criticism like an adult. @nytimes is real news
Not understanding why u have such a hard on about obcare.that has been ur focus ever since u started. But ur cabinet is under investigation?
what does your daughter and son in law advise you
m
They usually "get it," you just don't like it.
Nope, they are #fakenews partisan hacks committed to biased journalism.
Wrong.
Great argument 
Thanks, I learned from the best. 
Did you really understand the meaning of the text you quoted? #FakePresident
Donnie, you don't sound well this morning. You're too old to keep this up. Please get some rest.
he gets the rest he needs. He's the hardest working President ever!!
you'd think that the hardest working president ever would have something to show for it!
if you had your way for Prez we wld be flooded w/ illegals n your taxes wld go up to support them.
how you gonna talk shit then compliment them in the same tweet LOL
Im in Oklahoma. My husband owns a small business. We know! #tryingtoraisetwokids.
Pretty much sums up the last year of Donald Trump ...
... but don't worry, The Donald has #TrumpCare completely under control ...
but his own words may come back to haunt him ,,,
He did not Write thsi Book Tony Swartz did as a ghostwriter he found Trump to be Lazy and uninterested In Learning "ANYTHING".  Trump' SUX!
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR OBEYING OUR LAWS, FINE HEAVILY AND PUT IN JAIL THE SATES WHO REFUSE TO OBEY THE LAW.


So, wait...is the @nytimes still "failing" if they "finally get it"?
You seem confused.

So your idea is to take more? U r a greedy horror
According to the same polls that predicted Hillary's victory
You realize Trump's Campaign internal polls also predicted Clinton would win?
You realize she won popular vote by a large margin?
Yet. He is @POTUS. And that's all that counts #snowflake
Conservative hypocrisy=support a whiny snowflake while calling people snowflakes for providing facts they don't want to hear
so when they agree with your pov, they get it?
Change the fucking record! We get it, you like Obama
Perhaps you may also start to "get" that opening up the market to competition is not a solution. It takes too long and here is why:
Insurance firms would have to set up intricately complex networks in markets that they can be competitive in. This takes years.
The failing @nytimes finally gets it - "In places where no insurance company offers plans, there will be no way for Obam...
Insurance companies only care that profits increase under @trumpcare, and # of insured decreases, of course.
NYT  isn't failing but I understand you are. Everyone is saying it. Face it Donnie, you're the biggest loser.
@POTUS44 @MichelleObama where is 85 million out of ssa for obozo  care
"If you like your teeth, you can keep your teeth"
A P R I L   F O O L S !
So the NYT only "gets it" if they run something u like/agree with? WTF is wrong with you, #trump!?
You.
Must be great to live in an alternate universe where u only like people/things/media who agree with u...& then dislike 'em when they don't
... Says the mind numb koolaid drinking lib that only listens to media that pushes alt-left agendas
How are they failing? Fake Tweet!
THAT'S ALRIGHT trumpcare WILL NOT MAKE IT IN THE SENATE!
STOP DEFLECTING #45...ITS NOT WORKING ANYMORE #IMPEACMENTISCOMINGFORYOU

You are "failing" and the only one winning is the @nytimes. I'm confused how you keep getting it mixed up @realDonaldTrump
So you want obama care to die & not build on it & your plan bombed this is in your hands & will be the greatest or worst  move u will make
The NYTimes is not failing.  You are.
Everyone knows this.  Nobody thinks ACA is perfect, but you don't shave because of hair issues, you continually work to improve it.
his staff showed him a clip of a news paper that got him excited
The failing @realDonaldTrump Presidency doesn't get it.  ACA stays.  #TrumpRussiaCollusion remains the TOP STORY.
I thought you claimed to be "smart?" Your tweets are so painful to read.  Maybe if you read a book you could learn some English.
@cnn @msnbc @nytimes The failing Donald Trump does not get it.
When will the failing @realDonaldTrump @Potus finally "get it".  #ImpeachTrump #Impeach45 and #MAGA. 35% approval rating.
Good reason to have a public option!
Because of Trump I'm proud to be an American again! God bless Trump
Sigh. For the 1000th time, the NYT stock and readership is way up! More #alternativefacts in #Trumprussia!
And you're trying to sabotage American citizens' healthcare! Spoilsport!  Bad!
Obamacare supporters what will you say then. A few States have only one carrier left and threatening to leave because its not profitable...
Can't fix it so you rejoice that people are getting screwed by your failure. Such a loser strategy. ACA problems do not make you a winner
Why is it that every time I look at Trump tweets, it's always the libtard soros trolls that I see first? Twitter have a hand in this??
NYT will surely outlast you!
The tweet we point 2 when @realDonaldTrump & #GOP saw a problem & refused 2 work w/ #DEMS 2 fix it so they can blame @BarackObama
D.J.Trump, the @nytimes is NOT FAILING.  Its just more propaganda you're putting out.
Yes to that Donald keep doing what your doing and make everything good again thanks forever thang
Senile basturd, lost your train of thought again midtweet.
Which is why we need #SinglePayer #Medicare4All We want it and need it!
quit
Actually the nytimes has gotten 275,000 new subscribers in just the fourth quarter of last year when will this stop
COMPETITION ACROSS STATE-LINES IS ESSENTIAL~IF THERE ARE CHOICES~AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BEST PLAN 4 THEM
#trumpmentallyunfit
Like you never had business that failed.... Right
Only because they pull out of markets. They only care about profit. Same as you. Wonder if you'll lose your wealth for treason.
Dear POTUS Orange...
YOU ARE FAILING (35% APPROVAL), NOT THE NYTIMES. Come back to reality!
We Will Not Rest Until Donald J. Trump Is in Handcuffs and in Prison!!
Hmm but really, what about your treasonous ties to Russia? That's what we want you to answer! #treasonoustrump
They've tripled their readers idiot - just cant let it go can U - just like Hillary's 3 MILLION PEOPLE VOTES ! Happy B/Day Fool !

Mr Deal maker you could make deals w/ins.co's if you and the republs wanted to. You don't want to fix anything
You only want to take PRESIDENT OBAMA's name of EVERYTHING he did. Your administration is a mess CLOUDED IN LAWSUITS & HEARINGS.
Why can't you & administration answer any questions? DO YOU NEED HEARING AIDES? You are only making policies to benefit your rich buddies
Only thing failing is your treasonous administration. Soon you will be impeached and a laughing stock of the world (you're already that)
Wish you would fix ACA but you won't keep your promise of better HC for all.  Sad
You are so sad.
You're the failure!!
Go sleep; U need your rest-for golf-
Mr President I am praying for you. I can't understand why people don't love this country and try to destor everything Americans have done.
Yes FAKE NEWS like the onion but not clever or funny just a waist of everyone's time they could just watch Fox news and be informed#MAGA
we don't want insurance, we want national Heath care.
So is this you trying to be civil? Had to add the word "failing" Make a deal & get insurance companies to offer plans That's called WINNING
The Democrats and the Freedom Caucus OWN failing Obamacare.  Let them twist in the wind, Donald.
So you want people to die? Shouldn't brag. Find some humility and basic compassion. Check WH closets. Maybe some was left.
Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Trump
Ur rants r proof that u care about your image....not us citizens!
So what's the plan Don?   What does #trumpcare look like?   #MAGA #DrainTheTrump
so, why did you craft such an awful bill that even Republicans wouldn't support it?
The failing donald trump seems happy that his countrymen/women/children have shitty healthcare. SAD.
You take excerpts out of context. Try learning. #fakestupidman
Mr. President where did you get this information? NY Times, who you say only publishes fake news.....until you read something you like. Sad
as opossed to Trump Care that YOUR OWN Party HATES!! Mr Art of the CON and NO DEAL. USELESS taking up space!!!!!
Lies ......fuck #Trumpcare #TrumpcareFail  #ImpeachTrump
Thank the Lord!  All BO did with ACA was give 20 MIL free insurance at the expense of 40 MIL of the middle class working folks paying $$$$$.
You don't care about sick people.... You want to have more money for yourself and to pay your debts to Russia & China. Compassion nyet.
Of the 34.7k tweets u have put out, u have only liked 0.00123% of read tweets. Sounds a bit like ur approval ratings
We've all known this, you dolt. Stop tearing others down to try to make you look better. Improve Obamacare and move on. Stop repeating.
Keep up the good work.  There are many Christian's praying for you.
Jared Kushner's brother owns a healthcare company btw so you're controlling the market
Just shut up about healthcare.  It's too complicated for u!
Who advised u? Bannon? Mercer? Jared? Nigel Farage? Alex Jones? Vlad? U've got a great little propaganda machine.

Call it by its right name: The Affordable Care Act
Thanks for making a case for Medicare for All!
Shouldn't you have worked on fixing THAT rather than your lame attempt at killing the poor while enriching the wealthy with more tax cuts?
Stop, just stop. Your fake news and tweets are a joke. No one believes you. No one.
Are you a red herring preventing world war?
You simply hate the black man way better than you will ever get. U r not even worth the sole of Obama's shoes.
I still believe the companies backed out because of greed/profits! Maybe they do need some regulation!
Shameless plug: The NY Times once did a fantastic story about our region and farm. See:
Maybe the government could tell them they need to cover people and not just gouge the poor and make the wealthy richer? #impeach45
Then maybe you should add on the public option? You don't care if people die. All you care about is attention, golf & money. You're a child.
BLACKWATER RAISES DEEPLY DISTURBING QUESTIONS WHERE IS AMERICA BEING LED BY NEW BREED OF FREE-MARKET MERCENARIES @BetsyDeVosED

The @potus calling the kettle black
Pity that #FreedomCaucus blocked the proven $1Billion savings on #Obamacare+end of PlannedParenthood-baby-murders,despite 5changes made4them
LOL the only thing failing is your presidency
So unpresidential for a Fake President; grow up! The hate spewed by Trump is nothing but jealousy and envy of Obama's accomplishments. Sad!
