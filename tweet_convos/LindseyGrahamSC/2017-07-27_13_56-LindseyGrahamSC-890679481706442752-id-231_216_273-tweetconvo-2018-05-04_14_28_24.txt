RINOs!
@TGowdySC #TGowdyForSenate2020
So much for standing up for principle.
You voted for it despite Ryan gearing up for a weekend vote.
Senator Murphy explained it to you...
.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how the #SkinnyRepeal bill that Senate GOP doesn't want to become law...will become law. A must watch. 
RHINO, Swamp Dwellers, all 3. Demand th/Congress be on the same Health Care Plan as the American people  then we'll see some bipartisanship!
Big whoop at this point.
Ever wondered why #Senate approval ratings are so low? 
Recall your "this bill is a #fraud" and then voting "yes" on it.
#Trumpcare @gop
Disappointed that Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC voted "yes" after indicating he would not. Glad he is standing up to Trump on other issues though.
thoughts? @mattevanprobst
My hope is that they are announcing their opposition to the skinny repeal plan, but I've no clue. 
Johnson has grumbled throughout process, McCain has been ornery today, Graham less so. Lotta people holding their breath watching this.
Okay so they're just begging for slightly more credible empty promises  from Ryan that the terrible bill they will vote for won't become law
But the problem of a conference is that it'll push the resolution of this past the deadline that the insurance providers have coming up.
If the providers don't know wtf is going on with the ACA repeal or subsidies, they'll save their profits first. The markets collapse.
A conference creates the perfect storm for the ACA to be "allowed to fail" regardless of what the conference ends up producing.
Ah, but if ACA is "allowed to fail" they think they can skirt the blame, pretend that it is just hated Obamacare imploding as predicted.
"We will all vote 'aye' while remaining duly troubled about all of it."

Words that just turn to dust.
Don't care what they say. I care how they vote. The can talk till blue in the face. In the end it's the vote that matters
Big fix. let Obamacare die.
What that ur gonna keep screwing us over!
You talk big but don't have the balls to follow through! Party before country every time, loser! McCain took the hit for you. SHAME!
Now put America over party and act on what the majority of Americans want .. for congress to reach across the aisle and Fix ACA
party over country..just like a good little nazi..i mean republican. how could you have voted yes? take away your own insurance.
I look forward to these wise men explaining why they oppose this perversion of the legislative process but will vote "yea" anyways.
Thankfully, I was at least 33% wrong with this one.
Listened to your press conference. Despite never receiving your "assurances," you STILL voted to pass Trumpcare. SHAME ON YOU!
Trumps base never trusted McCain.
I'm disappointed in your vote..
What happen to honesty and integrity. Repeal Obamacare. What about Free Market Insurance -no government. Where is the ability to lead???
It's the dream team of talking tough and folding like cowards.
Senate needs change starting with Graham
Your friend Mc is despicable liar. Why doesn't he end his career a Dumocrat.
No need to watch then. They're just spiteful idiots with desire for control.
Sen. Graham: When you had that "great" meeting w/ POTUS 2 wk on ur HC bill, did you tell trump not to threaten your fellow Senator?!!!
You met with Trump about your healthcare bill. Are you going to take @SenJohnMcCain position & call for regular order & bipartisan input?
After saying it was a fraud he voted for it anyway. Disappointed.
TRAITORS ALL
Senator ! Why did you vote yes last night? It doesn't make sense how you voted base on what you said hours before!!
You got your camera time, talked a big game, & voted to kick millions off insurance anyway. Shocker. #coward #ownedbytrump #ownedbybigdonors
Talk is cheap Sen Graham. Thank goodness for McCain, Collins and Murkowski. You can do better. 
#healthcarevote
But 2 of those men voted for it in the end. Why?!
So explain to us again why you voted for it.
Shame on GOP Voters
Lindsey thinks he's more important than he really is, he needs to go, do your job, and let the President do his
This is where you said you would NOT vote for it. Who lined your pocket since then? #skinnybill
Please Senator vote no please ...
Are Republican in the Senate and in the house in the same party?   Why do the wash your laundry in public?   These Senators are pitiful.
Please senator Graham -- if you don't want this disastrous bill to become law DON'T VOTE FOR IT!!!
Just heard about your vote. Senator, you are a liar and a coward. Shame on you.
So, this is image control?
People do things in the dead of night because they're ashamed. Your health care vote will go down in history for its cowardice.
VOTE NO!
Don't do the partisan thing.
IF you believe in America then do the right thing for America, not the right thing for the GOP's base.
@LindseyGrahamSC How can you stand up and say this bill is a fraud and then vote for the Bill. Have some courage for God sake
PLEASE SENATOR: This is not how the vaunted Senate should operate - in the dead of night, Reject TRUMPCARE.
Please vote for the skinny bill to go on to the House; from a small business owner!!!!  Thank you
And now you've flipped. Disgraceful
Reason congress has a 12% approval rating. They don't listen to experts - @AmerMedicalAssn , @ahahospitals , @AARPadvocates @RNAction
Say one thing and do the other. How honest of you!  Typical partisanship.
They are going to vote for a bill that they don't think should be law.

This isn't how our system of government is supposed to work.
VOTE NO on #SkinnyRepeal You know it is awful. Stop playing chicken with our healthcare #SaveTheACA
I have a preexisting condition and I beg of you to do the right thing. PLEASE VOTE NO!
Graham says "Me and the Above GOPs feel We can work with the Freedom Caucus to Kill more people, skinny plan is not enough"
Graham says "The GOP encouraged People NOT 2 sign up thereby causing uncertain markets and higher premiums"
You have just proved @PutinRF_Eng right about our system  isn't so special. Anything goes and it is not about the citizens
Speaker Paul Ryan has not promised a real conference. House will just pass through the "skinny bill"

After 7 years of campaigning on replacing the ACA, the GOP wrote their bill over lunch, posted it at 10pm and are gonna vote at midnight.
Sen, you have turned out to be a disingenuous weasel.
And 4 hours later you agree to vote yes on a bill you called terrible.  Way to look out for the people of South Carolina.
Leave the Party. You are part of the problem.
You better not pass the skinny repeal bill. You're a constitutionalist, and this is a complete violation of the US Constitution.
Plus, Kevin McCarthy announced members should not leave so they can obviously pass it via martial law. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html?referer=android-app://com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox …
Do not sell out the American people and their access to medical care for political gain #NoSkinnyRepeal
Nope lindsey petered out.
Don't vote for a bill you don't want to become law.  Seems like it doesn't require a press conference.
don't be a coward & turn on your country, the history written of you will not be about the votes or favors you won, but what you did
ST8 OUT REPEAL'THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ..TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP...GET WITH THE PROGRAM OR GET OUT ...TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
Is that really John McCain or an AI?
You think u are to big to get voted out guess again!!! U vote for skinny repeal... u r OUT!
@LindseyGrahamSC Coming in from Travelers Rest.  We are better than this process, and I believe, so are you.  Vote "No" and start over.
Hard to imagine how the Senate could accept any "assurances" from the House Wing Nuts on anything, much less anything as important as HC.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain 
Just abstain, for the Lord's & sanity's & truth's & righteousness' & principle's & regular order's sakes.
@SenJohnMcCain With your Brain Cancer Diagnosis, I wonder how cavalier you would be about Medical Insurance-IF IT WAS YOURS BEING GUTTED!
@SenJohnMcCain you are so full of sh*t. You stood before the Senate, and said you would NOT vote 'yes' for replace/repeal, & THEN YOU DID!
Please vote NO on this irresponsible "skinny repeal"! We need you to be a patriot and stand up for America 
they could care less, GOP have GOVT CARE 4 LIFE
Senator Graham, I'm dismayed that you would gamble w/ the health care system and vote for skinny repeal. Gambling is a sin! You know better!
Spare us, please!
There not going to fix anything.They're just waiting 4their Huge TaxCuts.P.Ryan has dreamt about this moment!  #VoteNo .@LindseyGrahamSC
Do not repeal ACA!! No one party can solve the issues of healthcare it will take both parties working together for Americans!
We don't trust Paul Ryan or the GOP to develop a healthcare bill! Every bill your party has presented would devastate Americans healthcare!
If the three senators are true to their word, I admire speaking truth to power. I may disagree with you on some policy, but mad respect here
That should be a truly spectacular RINO party.
Patient advocacy groups, doctors' and hospital groups, medical societies, insurance companies...NOBODY likes the GOP bill. Don't vote 4 it.
OK---now walk the talk.  Everyone back off and put together a REAL bill that protects humans.  Time for country before party.
If you are man of your word you vote no, Ryan gave no assurance
Manny, Moe and Jackoff.
@SenJohnMcCain if youdon't want a bill to become law,  don't vote for it,  assurances from lyin @SpeakerRyan are worthless
Graham and McCain needed their fix of glowing praise about how level-headed they are before they #fallinline and do what 45, gop want. Yawn.
12 patient orgs, 1 message: Skinny repeal will be a "devastating blow to our health insurance system and the Americans who depend on it."
You arent the President stay out of his affairs and repeal and replace
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI  I have respect and trust in ONE person in DC and that is @realDonaldTrump  ONLY. This is GOP
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI  I am at the point now I have NO hope or respect for the GOP; you're as bad as Dems.....
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI  3.  This is a message from Eric Cantor; he would know. This was all a ruse for Votes & Funds.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI   2.  This is WHY you never had a plan after 7yrs. YOU now have the chance and FAIL. SHAME onU
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI I read an article yesterday I believe now. GOP NEVER had intentions to repeal Obamacare .....1
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI  So House makes changes and passes it back to you; money keeps getting added & it's Obamacare!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI  All 3 of you are RINO's. Lindsey you retweeting Jacobs proves that. You're always against GOP
Do you seriously imagine that you can trust them to keep their word?  Please vote no!
Poor excuse for a senator
@LindseyGrahamSC - URGENT! Speaker Ryan will NOT KEEP promises, & no bipartisanship! Speaker and Senate Majority leader control conference
The THREE of you are the LAST PEOPLE the American PEOPLE want to hear from! All of you believe YOU are speaking for the voters.. YOUR NOT!
Don't pass that bill

Only "holy hell to pay" is going 2 be u, McCain and others for war crimes!  #Silkway #SouthCarolina #SC #southerncharm #Clemson #Gamecocks

Senators now believe they have a veto over who the President allows to serve him. Let's grab our constitutions... @POTUS #DrainTheSwamp 
New rule.. all of congress, senate, any politician that deemed themselves exempt must live off Ocare from here out. That'll learn'em
SC 5th voter. Please be a true southern PATROIT. Vote no on the skinny bill. Lindsey you gave up your life 4 your sister.  Sir you know love
Care to state this in layman's terms so the rest of us know what the hell you are talking about?



Imagine being so afraid of the potential political backlash that you would vote for a bill you admit is terrible. #TrumpCare #SkinnyRepeal
Smart people expecting Bi-partisanship behavior from Sen/Reps never exhibiting such behavior? Tooth fairy or pay offs?No-Skinny Bill!
I have a better idea -- vote no.

Hi, my name is Lindsey Graham and I vote for shitty legislation because I am an idiot.
This is beyond treasonous. Just vote or leave the party and let the Democrats run the Senate.
For heaven's sake, if it's so bad, JUST VOTE NO! You are such a wimp.
These Wanna say their republicans. Oh No they're actual democrats in denial working against we the ppl! Vote these guys out asap
Repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal repeal Obamacare RINO RINO RINO RINO RINO RINO
Did anyone watch this ridiculous course for these 3 to be on TV. The should all resign there Senate Seats for not doing there jobs
Please vote No
BFD
You are a fraud if you vote for this fraud. #shame

https://twitter.com/igorvolsky/status/890682573990580225 …

Stopped believing a word any of them utter a while ago...double talk all day, every day
   
@CNN is reporting that Johnson, McCain, Graham *will* vote for #SkinnyRepeal.…

Hopefully not supporting it
Three little pigs!! Arrogantly laughing at us! They know what's best for America. Really it's for themselves! Sickening!!
I have NEVER heard anything as stupid this speech. You vote for it it's yours. Explain this in a debate.....,hahaha.
Please take the insurance providers to task as well
Sorry Graham- but I kept my drs. On Aca - have great coverage
If you vote for this "healthcare" bill then you own whatever death and destruction it brings.  @SenateMajLdr is a conman.
How can you say everything you just said about the skinny bill & still vote for it? There is no guarantee of what the conference will yield.
You just called the skinny bill a disaster and a fraud. How can a disaster and a fraud be a reasonable starting point for a conference?
Vote "No" on the skinny bill and start a bipartisan process now.
A joke. Blame the greedy CEOs of ins. CO's. Single pay is best. No examples of how it has helped so folks only one example of how it hasn't
So you will vote for a healthcare bill that you never want to become law. Sounds a lot like dereliction of duty! Coward.
Establishment GOP want to give us single payer
.@LindseyGrahamSC  If this bill is the canard you say it is, why would you vote for it under and circumstances?
Block grants with no cuts for Medicaid sounds great!
No to skinny bill!  GOP house will pass it and take 16 million off healthcare. GOP House already voted to take 23 million off healthcare.
Great example of why GOP will lose control of Congress next year
Graham: "The skinny bill doesn't work for any state."
@SenJohnMcCain We don't need a presser. We all ready know 16million more ppl w/o insurance, premiums go up 20%. Just vote NO!
You say you will trust Mitch. Well, he didn't trust y'all to show you his bill.  No block grant to states.  No tax cuts. Don't defund PP.
Moe, Larry & Curley need to pack their bags & take their show on the road & any others who want to play thar way.. Time 2 elect some workers
And Graham lied about representing us in SC. He doesn't listen to us. He doesn't talk to us. He's too busy running his mouth in DC.
Americans appreciate how you, McCain, Johnson are doing the right thing with finding a viable alternative. One republican on your side!
#Vote4SkinnyBill @realDonaldTrump @MeghanMcCain @RepBillJohnson mitchellvii Harlan @mike_pence @
VOTE NO. What more is there to say? Oh, just this...
Listening to you speak re: Skinny Bill. I DON'T want you to Repeal ACA BUT I am happy you are speaking against the Skinny Bill. Thank You!
Enjoy your last term in office Lindsey
Our brows will be furrowed
whew. Just enough time to take a piss and finish the Browder testimony video.
Skinny bill repeal policy is a disaster! What is going on? Conference? Really? NO Way!
I LOVE YOU @LindseyGrahamSC !!!
Bad bill = vote no
Bless this man for having morality
As my senator ur voting just to be voting to move this on solidifies that u need to go next election. This is NOT what most Americans want!
Roger Stone is now threatening violence.  Are you going to do anything to stop this madness? https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/890621599359000576 …
They know what they are doing is so base that a coup could happen...

And still they persist

You would think they'd almost want one 
Purdue dropping out gives hope.
This is stupid.
This better not be their same old self-important tut tutting while they vote to destroy the Senate and America as usual.
McCain? He's gonna denounce it at 5:15 pm, pass it at 11:15 pm
If Perdue was involved at some point they are voting yes.
MSNBC if Perdue is there they are caving.

*mouth fart noise*

I hope they realize the absurdity of what is happening and put an end to this freaking nonsense.
Don't hold your breath.


EVERY GOP THAT VOTED YES WILL OWN THIS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WORK WITH DEMOCRATS TO FIX THE ACA and never had plan after 7 years
Graham voted for full repeal yest. so I am really skeptical that he is going to be against the skinny repeal now.I bet McCain is ok w/it now
they still believe in press conferences?
dare I be a little more hopeful? At first the inclusion of Lee and purdue wasn't inspiring confidence
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @RonJohnsonWI This entire process has the US Senate looking like a kangaroo court. Return to Regular Order!
The House has already voted to vote straight on skinny repeal: there is no conference committee! @SenateMajLdr has lied to you!
idiots only trust Trusts McConnell
