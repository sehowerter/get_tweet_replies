No it is not. This is much worse! The possibility of the president & co colluding with Russia is treason! INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION NOW!
you're right. it's worse.
Five Reasons the Comey Affair Is Worse Than Watergate (via @Pocket) #longreads
You guys are loons
All these "droves" of democrats you speak of calling for Comey to go was in 2016, during election, b4 anyone knew fbi trump investigation
Deputy AG did or didn't get Comey fired. @LindseyGrahamSC  says yes but @realDonaldTrump  says he did it.  Anyone know? Story changes.
Although we've seen some corruption, it's more about misappropriation of funds. We did have 1 issue related to unclear rules re expenses.
Lindsey is either lying or he's clueless.
No Senator, it is much much worse. Apparently you are fine with treason and subversion of our democracy as long as your party wins #traitor
We're going to primary you ....
No. It's much worse and you know it.
@LindseyGrahamSC  This is worse than Watergate, this is treason. If the Republicans do not do anything you are complicit. #ImpeachTrumpNow
No it's worse !  Watergate was a break in.  This is an attack on our country and possible collusion!  Treason....Way worse!
@gop been in projection -political mode for so long theyre unable to take reigns govern & lead

Their president has taken their opportunity
It's bigger Lindsey. #liar
NO, it's worse @LindseyGrahamSC
No it's worse you chuckle head
He's correct. It's much worse. At least in1973 GOPs weren't ALL traitors.
Republicans see no evil
Worse. GOP won't investigate potentially treasonous President & have demonstrated contempt/mockery for poor/vulnerable citizens.Shameful.
No. Its so much worse.
You're right, Senator. Watergate was a two-bit burglary. This is treason, and a malignant narcissist with the nuclear codes. Do something.
Really, you are the only person not picking up the connection
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli this is worse than Watergate. Russia was in our election. Stop ur collusion.
You're right. It's worse. It's a Russian coup. Step up! I know you have it in you to do the right thing! Save your country, not your party.
In Canada, we have limits on allowable spending each candidate can procure and utilize, & they have to report ALL their campaign spending.
This is MUCH WORSE than Watergate. WAKE UP!!!!
Perhaps a wee bit off topic but ...
TERM LIMITS PLEASE!!
There, that's better.
Nope. I want GOOD Congress members to stay as long as they like and bad ones to be voted out!
Aaaaaand how's that workin' out so far??
If you need a 'hint' as to how that's workin' out, try the info below ...
#TermLimits 
http://bit.ly/13gX7kz 
... and currently:
Many have huge campaign 'war chests' & high net worths from 'serving the people' System is broken
Yes the level of corruption seems to stem from the ridiculous rules (or lack thereof) around campaign financing...
It's WORSE Than Watergate and you have a job to do. Stop towing the Party line and do what's best for our Country!
Graham and most of the republicans have absolutely no honor or integrity!!
No, it's not Watergate.  It's much much worse and even scarier since we have no GOP in Congress willing to be patriots.
Oh no. No you did not just. 
Hear me now and quote me later graham
You're done
We need to see open, public, hearings to trust outcome. No one will be satisfied with spec pros results if process/evidence not transparent
1:40 Come again? @LindseyGrahamSC how many times in US history has an FBI Director been fired? #TrumpRussiaInvestigation @KeithOlbermann
How about a new comment post-@LesterHoltNBC interview? Nothing to say? It's time for the 25th to come in to play and you know it.
We need an extensive investigation on DT ties with Russia. 
Have you ever seen a cover-up with no underline crime?
This is worse than Watergate! The people are on the verge of revolting! Are you going to be part of the destruction of Democracy?
2: he fired comey because of pussia probe. Will you keep waiting idly by? Its like youre almost tough but back down and cower like you did
Omg @LindseyGrahamSC since when would trump do a favor for schumer or waters or anyone for that matter by firing comey. He just admitted
Are you out of your damn mind? It is worse than watergate. Maybe your involved to and that is why you won't do anything about it.
No it's much much worse....
Lindsey - Please watch the entire @LesterHoltNBC interview and them tell me HOW 45 should continue as POTUS. We are going down the drain.
Will the @GOP put the Republic over the Republicans?
Yeah- it's worse.
Yeah. Worse
Lindsey I'm not sure what #Trump has on you but whatever it is I'm telling you it is just not worth your soul - #SpecialProsecutorNow
No Lindsey, it's not watergate, IT'S FAR WORSE! COLLUSION BETWEEN OUR PRESIDENT & A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT - even Nixon wasn't that corrupt!
President should fire his press core. They all lied about Comey firing. Trump said so. Are you really supporting this lying SOB?
Correct, it's collusion with a dangerous enemy of our country. No worries, right? Carry on, Senator, with trashing protections for the 99%!
Please work on both sides of aisle to get to the bottom of Russia issue once & for all- No matter what happens, the truth shld be dealt with
sure feels close- it's either trying to cover it up or the most incompetent political person in centuries

You are guilty of the biggest #Coverup since #Watergate. #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCollusion You have no credibility 
No, it's worse.
No its worse than Watergate ever was .
Hey Mr. Lindsey, John Dean called it like Nixon during Watergate
Parallels to #Watergate are astounding it's as if its being used it as a playbook #CountryOverParty #dotherightthing #TrumpRussiaCollusion
@LindseyGrahamSC  Im so disappointed I thought you were in DC to do the right thing for all Americans not just to pander to your party #sad


These photos of Trump-Russia meetings are courtesy solely of Russian MFA because no US press allowed in. 

Vladimir Putin personally asked President Trump to host Russia's foreign minister in Oval Office, per Susan Glasser: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/10/james-comey-firing-trump-lavrov-putin-215124 …
Level headed
Sen. Graham still flying the GOP flag despite desire to pursue #RussiaGate.Good to hear he did not vote for Dictator Trump.
Yet... #FollowTheMoney
Senator, this is much, much worse than Watergate. We need an independent special prosecutor. Stand up for your country, not your party.
No, it's worse. Trump is acting like a dictator. Get Trump under control or get a special prosecutor so he can be removed.
So, are you also ok with the Russian media in the Oval Office? #DoYourJob
You don't know how bad it is yet Senator. We need an independent prosecutor.
Yes. Yes it is, Sen Graham, whether that seems right to you or not. 
Conflict my ass what do you think Obama has been doing for past 8 yrs you think he hasn't interfered in elections!
@LindseyGrahamSC WG was about greed, paranoia domestic power. This is about selling out our country to an admitted enemy-treason.find balls
The System is completely compromised-In order for Justice to work at all it must be dealt with Integrity,respect & trust. This is Tyranny!
It's worse than Watergate. Much, much worse. Seriously, why are you playing dumb? You're going down on the wrong side of history. Shameful.
I hope you are right but I fear you are not correct this time
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli it's worse...trump has sold out his country to Russia and is undermining our democracy.
Hillary lost, then screamed, "THE RUSSIANS DID IT!"
Graham mounted that dead horse named Red Herring and still riding hard ... in a parade.
No, it's much worse. Perhaps you need to have a talk with Sen. McCain over some vodka on the rocks. He'll fill you in.
it's worst!
Yet.....
please stop  fake news and posturing for Democrats and fake news go trump administration
Also a headline that isnt really representstive of the video's main content. Extremely disapointed w/ this BUSINESS account's tweets of late
No sir it's worst, veeeeery worst.
You are correct. This is not Watergate.... it is SO much worse. Are you in on it, too Graham?! #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #SpecialProsecuter
No,@GOP #Treason to #Watergate as #OJsimpson is to #Jaywalking @LindseyGrahamSC #shame ! #HistoryTells I #Patriotic
The fear in his eyes...
If #LindseyGraham doesn't remove his head from @realDonaldTrumps butt sometime soon he's gonna get a severe case of pink eye
Well spoken Senator Graham. Covered Democrats, Trump, Russia, Comey, next FBI director.
Well it was ...and then you were shown somethings (not pretty) and now.. it's not Watergate"
No, it's worse than Watergate. We didn't have to worry that the Nixon Administration was loyal to Russia. #TurnOverEveryRock
He's right.
Old and busted: #Watergate
New hotness:  #Comeygate 
#JamesComey #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
It is WORSE! Nixon did not sell out the country like Trump did to the Russians.  We are angry at the GOP.  We will vote.
This is a shame on Congress for letting Trump do this.  Impeach him now.
Nope. It's way worse. That was a 2nd rate burglary. This is treason.
Where there's smoke there's usually fire. How do u know what anything is when u refuse to support an independent investigation? #TrumpRussia
This is the USA! Not the island of magambomamba. You can't fire a person investigating u ! What part don't get ms. Graham
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli This is worse than Watergate. It didn't put the world at risk. Trump must be removed NOW!
Russia didn't change my vote. The fact that Hillary was the alternative did.
ITS WORSE YOU PUTZ. OH EXCUSE ME. Senator Putz.
It's much worse @LindseyGrahamSC . Please show the courage to do something about it.
Witness the end of @LindseyGrahamSC career. Nuzzling up to the GOP and Trump will not EVER be forgotten by the people of SC who are ashamed.
@LindseyGrahamSC are you afraid Trump will force you out of the closet? Is this why you ALWAYS toe the line? Hint: we already know.
He is right. It is much WORSE than Watergate. WG was about a stupid burgulary. This is about a president who is a treasonous traitor.
@LindseyGrahamSC No it's not Watergate. It's far worse than Watergate. Graham needs to step up to plate, call for special prosecutor.
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli Sen. Lindsey is golden!
It's worse than watergate, much, much worse
Watergate was domestic. This is international and potentially MORE dangerous.
Great. Now we not only have to investigate Trump, but we also have to launch a nationwide search for Graham's balls.
Graham says "This is Not Water Gate. Trump is just a guy who loves working for Russia"
No it's worse than that.
Graham is now lying. Too bad he's following in Trump's shoes.
No it's not watergate. It's worse. Watergate was not treason
You are enabling this lawlessness. You are not a patriot sir. You are complicit to what's going on. History will not be on your side.
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....guess what?
Trump fait des attaques personnelles parce qu'il n'a rien de substantiel à dire. Connard!
Toi aussi!
Its far worse than Watergate and u r now on wrong side of history
Risking Democracy to save face. Nothing short of treason!
Nope.  It's "Swampgate".
Well nothing can be the exact same thing?
No longer voting for @LindseyGrahamSC even if alternative is an incompetent. Something is seriously wrong with him.
I so agree, I live in SC too and he will GO, he thinks he has it in the bag, said so at town hall.
How would you know? Have you investigated? Nope!
Yes it's WORSE than Watergate!!
We can't hear you, @LindseyGrahamSC, there seems to be something in your mouth. #CockHolster
UR right. But WG wouldn't have been WG w/o a proper invest. Why deny an investigation now? It's win-win. It ends the nonsense, either way.
Maybe not yet, but stay tuned.
It's much worse!
Lindsey come on now that's a bunch of 
Sir - history will not be kind to you & rest of GOP for being accomplices/complicit to Russia coverup
No criminal intent?
1 obstruction of justice 
2 @SethAbramson gives you plenty of criminal intent
THIS IS WORSE THAN Watergate - give me a break - they have turned over our country to the Russians
Lindsey is correct, it is WORSE than Watergate.
"now they're going to get one" handpicked by Trump!  Forgot to mention that last part @LindseyGrahamSC
Lindsey, It is Worse than WaterGate ! Our Legislators Worked as a Whole to get Justice then .GOP is covering up for Trump, honor your Oath.
No, it isn't. Nixon didn't fire the FBI director to impede an investigation like Trump
Days Before He Was Fired, Comey Asked for Money for Russia Investigation, via @nytimes https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/comey-russia-investigation-fbi.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share …
@LindseyGrahamSC This is BIGGER than Watergate. Are you on the People of US side or you on side of RUSSIA.
Hey Senator. Looks like you do much better not being under the shadow of John McCain.
@LindseyGrahamSC He spends All his time on TV & tweeting instead of doing anything! #sickening #comey #trump #liar #noethics #cnn
@LindseyGrahamSC HOW THE HELL DO U KNOW? Amazing they don't realize how stupid they sound! U will go down like the Nixon Repubs #comey #cnn

@LindseyGrahamSC https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/862098542193766400 … 
True enough.  The KGB didn't hire the Watergate plumbers. Watergate concerned corruption and felonious dirty tricks.  Treason is different.
This IS Watergate(except more extreme and with frequently less bipartisn support)FBI bigger than Comey yes but still a huge flag.No  coverup
Pathetic. Grow some balls and stand up to this criminal administration! Every R that protects Trump will go down with him. We're sick of it!
It certainly is as close to Watergate as one can get! Don't be blind! This calls for impeachment proceedings. Abuse of power!
How will we ever know if it is or isn't if you and your party won't put country ahead of party?  Do your damn jobs
We need a new Senate Majority Leader who isn't Trump's lap dog like @SenateMajLdr McConnell. Sickening how he follows Trump's Russian ties.
Yes it's not Watergate, it's worse.  Our democracy has been attacked by a foreign govt but since no shots fired some are ok with it.
He's right - it's worse than Watergate!
Based on DAG letter, but word out that it was in the works before that. Most important: let special prosecutor figure out the timing 4 all.
I hope you are right placing your faith in the integrity of the FBI...I will try to share your confidence for the moment!
No this is way out past Watergate or politics. You need to lead about the right things Senator.  Appoint an independent special prosecutor.
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli 
Yes it is Watergate . Exactly like Watergate.... president firing his investigator.
And Lindsey Graham is not a partisan idiot.
No Sin-ator Graham, this isn't Watergate, it's Worser-gate.
You're right. It's much bigger. #SpecialProsecutor
Sin-ator Graham, 
You're disgraceful.
It's not Comey's firing,
It's the TIMING
Dozens of subpoenas just went out in Russia investigation!
And Comey asked for more money for the investigation!
No, it's potentially much worse.
"Attorney General well respected" you lost me after that.
Much worse than Watergate. Nixon was smart, not a kleptocrat and did not sell us out to hostile foreign nation.  Kompromat on GOP much???
Nope. It's MUCH WORSE and you know it!!
No this is much WORSE then Watergate Trump allowed a Russian spy to sit on the NSA-Our national security is at risk #Comey @TheLastWord
You are correct. This is WORSE than Watergate if Trump and campaign worked with each other to cheat democracy during an election. Treason
No. It's worse than Watergate.
And that was your defining moment.  You're part of the cover up.
This is much worst than Watergate. We are  being attacked by Russian and our President. Collusion at the highest level. You are covering up!
Watergate was small fry compared to what the courts are going to serve up against Team Trump.  #treason.
No. It's worse.
@LindseyGrahamSC @kevcirilli no it is not watergate is is much worse. It is not a party trying 2 affect another party it is russia
