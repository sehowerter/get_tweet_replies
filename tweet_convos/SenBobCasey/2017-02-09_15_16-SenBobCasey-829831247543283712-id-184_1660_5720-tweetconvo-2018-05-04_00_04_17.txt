.@realDonaldTrump should rescind this executive order tonight, abandon the religious tests & work on commonsense ways to increase security.
& work with countries to help stabalize their economies/security to reduce reasons why people need to migrate
send Casey please pull your head out of your ass just 1 time. As a sovereign nation we can deny anyone
what about Flynn? Why is it okay to have Russian spies working and living in the White House?!
Rock ON Casey!
if you truly believe that then maybe you should move to the 9th circuit.
No, it is anything but that.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for your leadership and your respect for the constitution.  @realDonaldTrump Stop wasting tax payer money!
no 9th circuit just a 90% failure look at their Supreme Court record
Constitution: 1
tRump: 0!
Yes!!!
How is this a victory for the constitution when US Code 1182 is in the constitution, proving this executive order is within the law
@LRBitisnot @realDonaldTrump thank you Sen.
Casey and the 9th circuit court of appeals. NIce to see Justice.
- why do you dumocrats like refugees.  do you think they'll vote for you?
another victory over a divisive potus who lies to and mocks the USA. It's only beginning unless he changes
ruling is unconstitutional and usurps power and action from the executive branch of gov and you know it. Pos
Thank you, Sen. Casey!
everyone I talk to in PA wants the extra protection of a ban. Again politician out of touch
Thank you @AppealsCourt
yes let's go with rule of law and enforce the 1952 law and Obamas 2015 law you betrayed of Americans everywher
you are a fool and an obfuscator of truth. The travel ban was not in EO. EO merely enforced Obama's 2015 law
Liberal court, overturned 80% of time on appeal! You just don't get it, PA voted Republican this time.
- then congress will change the law.
@SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders Given 45 announcing new security measures next week, it is imperative that you stay on top of EOs
That's crap and you know it.  Thanks for protecting America.  Can't wait to vote you out of office.
please explain how this EO is unconstitutional
more Americans support the Ban then those who do not
You will have blood on your hand went the so call refuges kill our AMERICAN'S #9thCircuitCourtofAppeals sickos
9th circuit ruling was against the constitution, you can't have rule of law without the constitution...
The order is not a ban of muslims, since a Christian from Iraq is just as banned as a Muslim from Iraq. It is within the law to
how can you possibly consider this Justice it's against the Constitution and National security is threatened
@BlueHumanity Now can you address the Russian election tampering and oil sales,sanctions.There is rampant corruption and greed!
We are still at war. IMHO I don't want to give IS the ability to hide behind the law.
wasn't he supposed to be the "law and order" Prez?  1st step, following the law!
.#RuleOfLaw? restricted immigration codified under Title 8 of the United States Code (8 U.S.C. ch. 12) @POTUS
Don't let him appoint SCOTUS and usurp the only branch of gov't keeping this fascist in check!!
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump senator We demand action on Flynn,  Trumps team and Sessions ! Investigations must start NOW
Not at All.
2 liberal judges and 1 token conservative.
It's not like we didn't see that coming.  It's not over!
"Congress shall make no law...."  Sound familiar?
Why is the 9th circuit court overturned 80% of the time?
High percentage of reversals is illusory, resulting from the circuit hearing more cases than the other circuits
That doesn't make sense but what does these days?
It kinda makes sense, best I could come up with, lol.
he Ninth Circuit’s best showing in recent years was October Term 2009, with a 60 percent reversal rate
Not what was ruled, stated, or implied.  Stop lying Senator.
_Misled by Trump's tweets, Custom,  Immigration violated Courts ruling. It's contempt, misdemeanor.
_Trump showed contempt and scorn  for Judge and Order which is a misdemeanor.
_Trump violated First Amendment,  ruling  by Justice Robert Jackson in Minersville School District v Gobitis.
Or #decency or #common sense
45 forgot 2 important things.. we actually have Internet and he is NOT above the law...
Your constituents should vote you out soon.  #RecallCasey
9th didn't even consider the law.
Apparently, Casey more concerned about non-citizens than his constituents
I love the radical new you.  Keep showing up as a Democrat.  Now fix the pharma vote dude
Don't you mean it is clearer than ever that the 9th circuit is the most liberal in the country?
Senator Casey, thank you for everything you do for the constituents of PENNSYLVANIA
just wait for scotus to hear this case.
Their reasoning is absurd.  Please read the decision.
you need to do more! @AndreaMatthews9
You being voted out of office in 2018 will be a victory for the American people. #MAGA
You Democrats chose the most Liberal judge you could find in order to go against Trump.
How can that ruling be for justice? It is clear that Liberal judges do not understand the law.
What kind of law do they teach in law school? How to legislate from the bench?
Bob Casey is in my state of PA, and I have been against most of his Liberal policies.
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump the EOs signed today really are alarming for our right to protest, are they just the start?
you are not listening to your constituents and putting us at risk, waiting for 2018
apparently you're as illiterate as the 9thCircuit and do not comprehend what their job isThe 1 AMERICANS pay 4
also unspoken rules that define American identity and make this country unique by inclusion, ps.
voted for you before but not in 2 years you care more about foreigners than your own people who voted for you
OY. M8. Wasn't an issue when your bloke was in office now was it?
It's very consistent with the rule of law when Obama does the same or Clinton or Carter, right?
how some DJT supports go from a 6 month slow down to BAN is beyond those of us who can read and process info.
muslims and not from any place that already attacked us and NOT from DJTs business countries we also understand what PBO 2/3
no worries Sen there are more of us that actually read/ process info. Not faux news We UNDERSTAND from DJTs own words it was1/2
@TZZToday @realDonaldTrump Keep up the fight, Senator.
@clarencehilljr @realDonaldTrump so when President Obama did it it was just fine right?  And Bush, and Clinton, and Carter...
Surprising that so many Republicans support this order.  @SenateGOP has changed so much in the last 30 years!
Yessirree Bob!
Ha.
The Pres has authority to act as he did in national interest. Another wrong decision by the liberal 9th.
Bullshit,safety before your tantrum over hilary, call it was
What it is sore losers!
Its clearer than ever that your real masters Bob are a set of unelected lifetime judicial oligarchs & tyrants
who have usurped the executive and legislative powers delineated in the constitution!
and you, you weak little man, revel in that because you are a petty hack, who is willingly enslaved!
while it is consumed by an un democratic oligarchy assuming powers unto itself absolutely! Shame!!
You claim Trump is the danger while our liberties, which you swore to defend, are shredded
no it is  not. Orders like this have have been carried out several times before.  You sir, are a liar
@clarencehilljr @realDonaldTrump So making it easier for terrorist to enter the country is a victory! WOW!!
Say GOOD BYE in 2018 Sen. Casey!
< The 9th district court is wrong! @POTUS has every Constitutional right to do what he wants 2 protect us!
@FrancisDMillet @realDonaldTrump U're willingness to ignore the law & constitution for political gain is sickening & disgusting
So you don't believe the President has been over reaching his authorit ?
Nope. The same laws that applied when Obama barred Iraqis applies now. Clearly states president has the authority.
Obama didn't bar Iraqis. Arrivals slowed b/c + more vetting & rechecked recent arrivals b/c print found on IED
Senator you're applauding the 9th circuit for ignoring the U.S. Constitution?
The left will readily regulate U.S. Citizens, but cry foul when non-citizens are regulated. #Schumernistas
Sen. Casey - thank you - we need you and other @SenateDems 2 standup & resist @attorneygeneral efforts 2 overturn
@FrancisDMillet @realDonaldTrump What is inconsistent wit th rule of law is judges that illegally over reached their authority
WRONG!
This was a victory for a feckless resistance.
Wake up PA! Time to DUMP bumbling Bob.
#NinthCircuit
constitution states that the POTUS has power to stop foreigners from entering the nation for security reasons
if anything happens America's blood will be on your hands.  #votecaseyout #americafirst
thank you!
You are lying u know it was within the rule of law. We are sick of the lying underhanded BS.
This will cost you dearly come election time, we are already organizing in our own quiet way. You've sold out!
You are such a fool, ignore the voices of PA, Americans for what? Your new voting block of liberal crazies?
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump is trump known for losing gracefully?
Wrong! Will you and your judges be happy when more American blood is spilled across our nation.
Hope you enjoy this short-term victory Sen. All the more reason to use the nuclear option on Judge Gorsuch.
most liberal, most overturned, and a very political statement. A sign of the times
Casey, you are a POS and you're going down.
Looks like a victory for the Constitution. Checks and balances like our Founders intended!
The people of PA have no voice in Casey-he doesn't care @ us-our voices-our concerns. Pandering to liberals
We'll remember you said this when American gets killed from terrorists!
No, it's clear that judges are too political.
Yes, definitely a victory for justice. Rule OF law > Rule BY law.
where did u see religious test? U r as bad as the rest of the left wing nut jobs!
Democrat victory? really? revisit your priorities
liberty persists. Justice persists. #ShePersisted
We'll see you at the ballot box!
this ruling is a death warrant to America.  Idiot liberals are destroying our country.  Vote more Dems out.
You are a typical Democrat. Being against your public safety will not be good for you
@madmommadmom @realDonaldTrump It's the 9th Circuit. What did you expect from the most overturned court in the land. #Libtard
vote Casey out . He doesn't care about the safety of Americans
Stop the madness anyone harmed will be on you! @realDonaldTrump thank you for continuing to fight 4 the safety of all Americans
yeah executive orders only seem to fly when they negatively affect the US
U
 should actually read constitution. He has right to protect America and it's citizens FIRST AND FOREMOST
The Clowns have arrived!
Thank u for validating us all who feel the same way. Ur conviction and strength of character r admirable
< A victory for justice? This is a slap in the face of America. @realDonaldTrump disregard the order and keep America safe!
Buh-Bye Bobby. Can't wait for you to be voted out of office in 2018.
yes!  Senator Casey we must find out trump Russian interference IMPEACH
wow you need a lesson in common sense.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Itsca Shame the Oresident cannot keep the US safe. If a terrorist attack happens blame it onLibs.
@billy_penn @realDonaldTrump BS senator Casey the president will win
what a loser  worry about Pennsylvania rather than 9th circuit ! Jobs is most critical issues inPA! You SOB Casey 
You all must NOT let Gorsuch get in.  Do no play nice on this one!!!!  He will break the tie in SCOTUS on this one for trump.
I'll be saving this tweet and send to back when an illegal commits a horrible crime. And it will happen. Dufus
.....Casey.....SCREW YOU .....
you're dumber than expected, especially for a senator. Try reading section 212(f) of the INA.
The ninth circuit just gave ISIS the opportunity to infiltrate. They must know more than our intel.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump 
Hey Philly - Casey is not on your side. Dont be fooled. None of them are.
https://www.google.com/amp/www.phillymag.com/news/2017/01/13/casey-toomey-against-drug-importation/%3Famp%3D1?client=safari …
but it was OK when Clinton and Obama did the same thing
@SenateDems your full of it! The text of the law fully supports the gov position. Out of control liberal court!!!!!!!!
thank you.
so how many are you taking into your neighborhood ?
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump What's crystal clear is these Judges are making decisions based on politics.
shows that politics are ever present in the courtroom, judges continue to inject their beliefs. #Dangerous
delighted to learn that US Appeals court did not reinstate the Muslim 7 country ban.
And that is where you are seriously WRONG! You will regret your tweet when the Supreme Court rules otherwise.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump He is not mentally well. Want to see his taxes and investigation into Russ ties so we can impeach
u mean Casey
no it is a victory for radical Islam not AMERICANS #9thCircuit #notmyruiling #USA 
The LAW is clear as day. When 90% of Muslim pop not effected, it's NOT a Muslim ban. He has info they don't.
are you on drugs? If anything it shows judges are political...it being constitutional was never the argumet

2 dozen to your house
says every dirty dem libtard
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump well stand by to be overturned again by SCOTUS liberal interest never the right ones for the US
You're a hack and should be impeached. 
As should the 9th Circuit.

@realDonaldTrump
DonaldTrump whats wrong with an exec order that is only temp so we can find out just exactly who is coming into our country.
@SenateDems I want some depositions to occur. I want to have the drafters on record. #presidentBannon should explain his side
grest news. Justice is seen to be done!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump We are watching! We the people demand you all resist this fake & Russian backed Pres consistently.
Thank you beautiful Judiciary branch 
or it proves our @potus is right 
these #socalledjudges  did not follow the #constitution
he is not correct AND there are better ways to handle immigration........
#victory #NoBanNoWall #ImpeachTrump #impeachPresidentBannon
HA! Major defeat for the clown @realDonaldTrump
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Very good!!!!!
Foreign nationals now have more rights than citizens for their safety. Sad that a lawmaker agrees with that.
Really? What extra rights?
Assuming you mean rights in the US. I know some rights people in most other countries have.
however Supreme Court fight ahead!
twitter for the win!  Broke the news before @cnnbrk  HOW IS IT possible, why is Wolf not reporting this?
The American legal system does it's job the way it's supposed to. Yes!!!
they will do their job when it reaches SCOTUS
Never get 5 to approve.
the law is clear the courts can't  make laws SCOTUS will prevail
Thet aren't. They are just bouncing the Don's stupid order.
a battle for the left but a war that will find its victorious in the end 
Why left or right? Do what's best for all USA! Your prez is not right!
65 million viewers agree with me. Elections have consequences
And Obama was wrong too?  Wrong decision.
So might I, if they come from any of the 7.
He already set this narrative into place by preemptively blaming the courts. No causality.
The 9th Circuit set the stakes.
he assigned the blame. They stuck to the constitution. There were better ways of achieving safety,
they didnt stick to constitution. It's frightening and a disgusting abuse of power
yes yes yes
so they ruled against the ban?? hasn't broken on news yet.
Thank you Sen. Casey!
