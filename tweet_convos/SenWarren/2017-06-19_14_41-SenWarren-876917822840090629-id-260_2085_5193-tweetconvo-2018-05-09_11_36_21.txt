Her bull shit spirit. Nothing but lies and bullshit. Horrible woman.
Really? Democrat run cities are in shambles. Her party is filthy with crime and scandal. She has no dignity. She's a joke and embarrassment
And now Illinois.  it's sad.
Boring
Thank you for fighting for us, Senator Warren! 
No hearings 
Zero transparency 
 NO BILL 
Wish you had resisted when they passed Obamacare
You are just stupid if you didn't know how many people were helped with Obama care
Being a nurse I know how many were screwed
As opposed to having nothing? Explain.
I've had nothing since Obamacare became law. Healthcare providers tend to discount care for the uninsured
And its not out of the goodness of their hearts. Someone is paying for it.
True. Just like before the change
Just like you did with obamacare
@SenWarren THANK YOU!  #HoldTheFloor #SaveACA  
Vote NO to #AHCA #Trumpcare #Deathcare 
#healthcare #HealthcareForAll #MedicareForAll 
Give them Sen Warren, as I know only you can.
It's complete bull that the American people aren't allowed to see this bill!! God help us if they pass this!?
Coming from someone with 21 followers!  Hahaha!  cashs80
I don't disagree that improvements are definitely needed. Hope that happens soon.
Why are you fighting against a chance to give people the chance to have insurance. Obamacare is not working and sinking fast. What then??
HahahahahahA
The Democrats didn't bother to read Obamacare before it was passed. Just ask @NancyPelosi  #Hypocrites
Where is C-Span available?
That's mature!
We demand retribution for the murder of Warmbier.
Democracy in action! Dems need to be aggressive. When Obamacare was drafted, R's were heavily involved in revisions. Big difference now.
About time!
Take your vitamins Dems. and best of luck the majority/resistance is behind you.
Lol, in what universe do leftist have majority?
Not leftists just people who are the majority of the country. Trump approval 38% GOP secretly taking HC away making it more $.
Not the maj.
Yeah because we know that polls always get it right
Quit watching FOX, Alex Jones, reading Brietbart. Trump is a danger to the USA & should be gone soon. The majority of ppl 64% want him gone.
Quit watching CNN, NBC, reading wapo and NYT. The majority of the people are with trump. You are the danger!
You're delusional get help. Dems & Resistance R trying 2 save USA frm Bcoming a country run by dictator. DJT will B gone soon he's a mobster
Will the list of policy benefits come already redacted?
Such an American. Using slurs dealing with native Americans. Don’t you want to know what is in this bill? They got to know what was in ACA
You had your turn at health care reform and fumbled badly. Sit down shut up and let real reform take place that will help Americans
@politico @FoxNews Warren we want Trump Care, that's why we voted for him and not Clinton!  I hope you aren't getting overtime or comp pay!
Obamacare is dying. Sold to public on keep dr, keep plan, affordable lie. Help to clean up YOUR mess.
Why?
Let it go thru. Trump voters asked for it & need to realize what they voted for. It is the only way we'll win back The Congress in 2018.
Just more Dems grandstanding for attention. Sit down Fauxahantas
Thank you!
DO ITTTTT
American's have a great way of twisting things. It's self defense when we do it but victims when it happens to them.
Defending the ACA isn't enough. Take your own advice Sen. Warren and don't accept the half-loaf. #SinglePayerNow
where was your fight when the aca was being pushed through?
So you complain you haven't seen it, then complain all that its taking away - which is it?
The truth: Obamacare steals affordable health insurance options from Middle Class workers to give free benefits to non workers. #repealnow
Thank you for fighting for all Americans, Dems!!
I want @SenToomey to explain to PA constituents and his @SenateDems colleagues why he supports this secrecy.  19047
Why don't you work to fix healthcare. No matter what comes out of this government has f--ked up healthcare. Never free or affordable.

Facebook keeps disconnecting when trying to watch, but it won't stop us, Thank you so much!
Why do you need to see the bill....???  Nobody read Obamacare before  your team passed it.
Keep at it Senator!  I'm a proud Minnesotan who 100% supports my reps @amyklobuchar @alfranken who work for all of us!' #HoldTheFloor
Thanks
Thank you, Sen Warren! #HoldTheFloor
Deny quorum. Turn your backs on GOP leaders when they speak. Impugn them. Daily group press confs. Relentless. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Damn your out of touch.
THANK YOU, SENATOR WARREN! You are true patriots.
really proud of your obstruction?
Seems there's a lot of positive responses here.  Repub sites have lot's of negative. I guess Repubs aren't paying much attention to you Dems
Thank you for all that you do.
Don't give up. Use whatever procedures available to you guys. McConnell Ryan Pence must be stopped. They don't work for us.
@SenWarren 
There is a way to stop this health bill until 2018
Please look it up by debate can't find who tweeted it
Please please look into
Nah...sounds like boring losers desperate for validation. I'll pass
#HoldTheFloor
Dems need to hold a Live Daily Press Conf on Trumpcare danger every single day. WH &GOP won't do press, Dems MUST take control of narrative.
Will you be using tomahawks and arrows? Face paint? Headdress?
Please be sure that bill represents all Americans not just a few and certainly reach across those isles!  Please
Your party screwed up healthcare as they do most everything.
Nope.
Tune off is more like it Lizzy!
So why did @NancyPelosi say this!
Free market.  Overcome your socialist tendencies and vote for repeal.  Open up markets for competition. PLEASE!  Thx!
Is #ShowUsTheBill like "We have to pass the bill to see what's in the bill"?
Imagine if you put all your energy towards #Country and #Constitution instead of #Party and #Power.
No thanks. I've got a life.
#WithholdConsent #SaveObamacare #HoldtheFloor #SaveMedicaid #SaveTheACA #KeepScreaming #No2AHCA #KillTheBill

Is this a real "hold the floor"? Seems like I've seen this before, Ms Warren...

#HoldTheFloor
Democrats hold the floor tonight to get details about health care the SOB Republicans hid in the middle of the night to hide from us!Our tax
How about you accomplish something rather than be perpetual #Obstructionists. 

You are literally the the Party of #ProgressPrevention

Fake News, Colleen!  Senator Warren is the only one fighting big banks for all of us!  Keep it up Senator!!! 
Vote it down!! How can anyone vote for a bill they won't show you?? Stupid....get rid of it!!!

@Amber_Addison_
#HoldTheFloor & keep fighting
Hit the floor Elizabeth and while you're down there polish my work boots.
@SenateMajLdr Objects to transparency. When the time come the people of this country should have 0 sympathy 4 or  leniency 4 him.
Nice move. Hold 300 million Americans hostage who are not affected by the new bill ..& you wonder why you guys are losing seats in Congress.
Yes, let's watch u ruin healthcare for generations to come!!
That doesn't even make sense. This health care charade falls on the Republicans shoulders!  Shameful!!!  
Shut. It. Down.
The trump care is no good that 13 men are guarding the billthat tells you how bad the bill is,women's rights are in jeopardy
#keepupthefight
You live to fight that's all you talk about thats why there's such division & not as much gets done for the American ppl like it could be.

#showusthebill you haven't seen the bill but will fight It? Hard working people are getting racked w exorbitant ins costs
@SenateGOP 2018 is going to be a real wake up call for the Republicans.
As long as it's a 2 party system there will be no change... abolish party politics
You have to pass it to find out what's in it... #IdiotDems #MAGA
We NEED to make this a thing #Trumpcare @MarkRuffalo @SenateDems @MyDaughtersArmy @SarahKSilverman #Trumpcare #Trumpcare
I hope that is not all they have to battle the abomination Trumpcare is.
You really need to learn a new trick.  Constant talking is a useless showboat tactic. How about betting relevant again. You're mall cops
2018.
Watch you continue to obstruct, no yhdnk you.
Go guys go! Thank you for putting the people first!
Want know whats in the bill till u pass it .what goes arround comes arround
what exactly are you doing to help this country? Resistance is not the answer Elizabeth! Why are you such a loser?
Sounds like you're the loser by your tweet, John.
Please keep fighting the GOP on this! Americans deserve & need quality, affordable health care.
This is fruitless and ultimately one of the reasons WE THE PEOPLE took you out of power. #sidelines
Watching right now. As someone who has had a disability for 26 yrs, you have my profound thanks.
Tell me how good your healthcare will be when Obama Care finally collapses? Asking for friend..
Do not let them pass this with backroom dealings. 23 million people need you to save them. Please.
Thank you,  (Dem) Senators for putting people first. Even the poor ones. I know the wealthy really need a tax break...
we support your efforts Sen Warren. Stop the madness!!
thank you!!!! thank you for fighting for US!
Why fight something that replaces bad ?
YOU are our voices! Stand strong for us and for our democratic process. Thank you for continuing to #Persist !

Thank you Mrs. Warren. Your courageous service is appreciated and needed more than ever
Make me puke will you?
So you would rather our Senators decide issues in secrecy? Where did you get that education from?
Fight! Will you fight for Obamacare? It's a mess & failing! But rather than work on solution you pull this crap
Nancy Pelosi said if you want to know what's in Obamacare you have to vote for it first. Hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite

Oh goodie. More juvenile unprofessionalism
Nope.

Discuss the AHCA publicly! No back door secret deals REPUBLICANS are famous for.
Time for Billboards to go up in (R) States  so the people 
You mean as Dems hold their breath like spoiled children.
You leftist are a paradox one day gunning people down next day pretending how much you care and the bottom line is
