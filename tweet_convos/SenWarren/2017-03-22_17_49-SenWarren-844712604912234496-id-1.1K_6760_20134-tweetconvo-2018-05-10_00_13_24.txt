Have a powwow Pocahontas, and figure it out.
he was on the trump transition team and probably knows 1sthand what went down.... he Must  Recuse himself now!
He works for @realDonaldTrump who works for the Russians & himself not for Americans!
@DevinNunes is doing a #MAGA job by keeping what cld be last draw of corruption to clear these investigations.  I trust him, some may agree
I believe he Spoke to the American People before he Spoke to Trump. So...The People I guess!!! #Nunes #ObamaGate
Your "cute" little hashtag reeks of paranoia and deflection.
time for a criminal obstruction charge.
The entire government should come to a screeching halt until we get answers. Stop the Gorsuch hearings!
The real ? Is who do U wk for? We know it's not the American Citizens!! Maybe Soros?
He works for Us the American ppl which is more than U or any corrupt democrat does
Lizzie has been out of touch for a long time.... she has dreams of being prez & pretending she cares while living in gated home.
I think he answered that question today Senator Warren. #BenedictDonald
Unlike the Democrat Obstructists who works for themselves, Nunes works for the people #DraintheSwamp
You're entire twitter account is warped. You Dems are so anti-American
Don't be silly @SenWarren!   Nunes, like all of them, work for Putin!   #traitors
not for you Pocahontas or UR fictional tribe
@barrick_obama @realDonaldTrump who do you work for?
I sure hope Devin Nunes thinks he working for the people of America and our elected President Donald J. Trump.We will let u work WITH us too
American People >> Synonymous Potus Trump.  Sit down Pocahontas.
@foolsrushn @realDonaldTrump we need the intelligence committee to investigate if he has any intelligence.
That's for damn sure. How long can we sustain this debacle?
Not long. I'm thinking we will be done with this mess by 8 August. Feeling kind of Nixonian :)
I think Rep.. Nunes has made his allegiance ABUNDANTLY clear. The ? is- what is the consequence?
impeach or remove already! We've had enough of this corruption.
clearly you believe fake news and don't even know what journalism is. Good luck living in an alt world. 
Frustrating to watch this & not be able to push eject or fast forward to the happy ending without #Trumprussia
I am so beyond disgusted with what @DevinNunes did today. There MUST be an independent investigation.
"Country over Party" you're disgusted w/Devin Nunes but no mention of being disgusted w/the surveillance/leaking CRIMES? #MAGA #tcot #ccot
Not a crime to use surveillance on foreign operatives. If you get caught up in that oh well. Plus Trumps own staff is more than 1/2 of leaks
It is a FELONY to unmask a U.S. Citizens name. Leaking is also a felony. Where's the proof Trumps staff is more than 1/2 of leaks?
I know Devin Nunes personally and your characterizations are I'll founded. foe once quit playing politics and look at the substance.
Neither. He works for himself. @JDignum @realDonaldTrump
Good catch.
well, who pays him more? Answer that and you'll have your answer to the original question. In Gold we trust!
He's going to be working for a guy named "Big Al" in his jail cell. And it's not going to be fun work.
You sure don't, you are only looking out for your self.  Wish people would see thru you for what you are.
The truth will not stay hidden as the looney Left would want. #LightIsOn
Unmasking and spying is the issue. Stop trying to distract from the crimes committed by the former administration.
Vladimir Putin
the american people are behind Trump. We are behind Nunes
Trump 37% approval rating
yep polled by the same group who said he was going to lose. You believe them?
The election polls were off only because DT supporters were ashamed to admit it.
instead of being mean, why not start a dialog with someone who doesnt agree with you
8years of no and obstruction and now you want dialog so you can rob the poor to line the pockets of the rich
? Does Warren think the American people dont have a right to know this?
Your question makes no sense
oh! .....I know this one!....@realDonaldTrump!!...what do I win!?!
front seat to the impeachment sound good?
The GOP stopped pretending a LONG time ago that anything but party is important. Nunes is a disgrace to snakes.
We need to get them out!! Keep fighting the fight, we NEED YOU! #resist #resist
Love, Your Constituents & Your Country
what a joke and embarrassment..drain the swamp!
Nunes reminds me of a 5th grader tattling to the teacher. So much for 3 independent branches of government.
You said a mouthful. Are you and the party the only ones doing any government these days?
it appears that @DevinNunes works for Putin
@AltUSPressSec @realDonaldTrump Putin
Clean up Washington? Washington is dirtier now w/ trump. You Dems need to start playing hardball w/ these people
Hard ball? Did you live under rock for last 8 Years.
This is wayyy over your head man.
Look Patrick Obama Admin unmasked & leaked Trump campaign staff. This is 1000 times>
YOU PEOPLE ARE GUILTY, and can no longer hide.
How many hundreds of thousands again for teaching 1 class?
Bet that was for the American people.
You wretched witch. Your party of good for nothings are going down and I can't wait.
He works for the people, you, however, we are unsure about who you work for.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump 

You NEVER ... EVER ... have anything good to say about POTUS Trump ... and there is something wrong with that
<---- Who does this work for? @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #TrumpTrain #tcot
Why is @AdamSchiffCA covering up obama admin felonies..and btw.. he shilled big league 4 crooked hillary.. Why do you lie? #SQUAW #Checkmate
Who do u u work for???  go back to your cave pocohontas nobody cares what u have to say.
Were you surveilled? And your information unmasked?
@DevinNunes works 4 22nd District (Ca)-Not my Rep, but doing right by me. #FollowFacts#Truth lonely, never easy, always right.
Manipulate emotions/anger of those U need 2 b told what 2 =U we r fools Offer substance/facts, not TPs->will listen Neither party 4 me
Wait until #OBAMAGATE breaks wide open.. The American people like what he is doing! Now, prosecute the leakers!
He's uncovering corruption you must support that and expose the IC rot
The law and truth
Hey,maybe he is more interested in truth, amirite, Tonto?
American people want to know who is leaking intel and risking our security!
Oh Lizzie just #Resign and do us all a favor. Libertards are running scared. Afraid of what @POTUS  is going to uncover.
Who do u think U work 4? It certainly isn't th American ppl & U  facilitated th destruction of th "TRUEAMERICAN DEMOCRAT PARTY". Shame on U!
Perhaps you should do a rain dance to find the truth
Yes. Definitely one of these. #solved
@2018Republicans @realDonaldTrump Rhetorical question right?
@Solutioneer72 @realDonaldTrump Who do you think? He's in it up to his as- neck.
@brontyman @realDonaldTrump Nunes is complicit and has kissed the ring of Donald to prove his loyalty.
self and trump
Who do you think you work for?  The people of Mass, or George Soros?
Please get 45. And his slime gang out of the White House!!
have you ever thought of looking up the word "Slander"?  You sure do enough of it.
He respects his President and doesn't whine about stupidities. Where were you the past 8 years?
pot calling the kettle.........
Quite apparently Trump
He's party aligned. Tell Ryan who tells Trump. Need and independent committee on this one.  Don't help the reps. They are bad.
@LisaMoraitis1 @realDonaldTrump Obviously Trump. His treasonous liason with Trump should be ground for removal.
LIBTARD, NO COLLUSION with Russia from FBI, NSA etc. Dem won't face reality.
Get to what matters, fixing America for Americans and Legal Immigrants.
plz take me out of this thread. As u can see, I don't insult repubs on their thghts. I'd appreciate the same.
@RiseUpAbove @realDonaldTrump My guess the Russians
#Impeach orange Julius
did you forget to take your insulin, Senator?
Put your beer down and go to bed, boy.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
@LPMagarian @realDonaldTrump or KGB/SVR ms senator
You are witnessing first hand what working in a bullying environment is like
@PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump Russia?
Why Putin of course
He's made that abundantly clear.
No cupcake, if you are a Trump fan, you support Russia and the global 1% of wealthy.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Suppose it depends on the bribes he's accepted from Con-Trump
Pocahontas have you ever thought about doing stand-up comedy?
AND WHO DO YOU WORK FOR, ANSWER, SOCIALISTS
Elizabeth Warren who do YOU think your working For? Your Not working for the American People or President Trump!
This is a case of the fox guarding the hen house. Devin Nunes  must be replaced!
Both.
As far as bullshit, it takes one to know one. No one has ever witnessed such a liar- Trump not Warren
Don't just tweet, file an ethics violation  complaint.
Who are you working for? Certainly not Massachusetts
is who he works for. We all know that.
Support #SinglePayer not opponents of positions you pretend to take indirectly supporting #WallStreet http://zacherydtaylor.blogspot.com/2017/02/elizabeth-warren-makes-me-scream.html …
Don't like #Trump but not going to argue in favor of depriving public of information they need to make decisions
he works for the potus and Americans. unlike you who works for noone .drain the swamp! u first
HE was working for US when he  TOLD US the truth of what OBAMA and YOU PEOPLE REALLY DID! YOU ARE THE CROOKS!
Exactly!! Resign immediately Nunes!
Nunez did the right thing.
Trump
Both... He's the president of the United States of America. Get use to it!!
The American people and TRUMP are the same... You are not. Who are disgraced.
he thinks he works for the #Trumpanzee
@DevinNunes  Provide proof of surveillance documents to Schiff U #lyingpolitician Nunes!
He's a good boy Nunes. He knows which side of his bread is buttered! 
He works for DonTheCon
Trump
- he works for us American citizens which I think you need to be reminded that you do too !
Someone has to put a stop to what's happening in Washington,,Nunes is a joke
Paul Ryan TOLD Nunes 2 bring the intelligence information 2 Trump!Could Trump legally hinder the FBI or issue pardons?
trump
@icare4america16 @realDonaldTrump he knows he works for the people, so, he went to the people's @POTUS #WeThePeople
your clearly nuts.
Trump has the power to fire. Obviously Nunes looking out for #1 and #2. American ppl is a distant 3rd.
@mlcreader if not them then themselves. They don't have contituents, right?
@mlcreader @realDonaldTrump honestly senator im pretty sure the GOP thinks they work for either Reince or Ryan. #orMitch
This guy is very transparent
That is a stupid question, Trump. The American people should indict this traitor.
you know the answer.   Make it stop until we know who doesn't work for Putin.
@icare4america16 @realDonaldTrump YOU ALL WORK FOR AMERICAN VOTERS! Your party illegally unmasked names of Amer citizens! GUILTY!
he spends all his time kissing trumps as-
He certainly doesn't work for you Eli. Or the Dems. Or the FAKE NEWS MEDIA.
Clearly not the #American People.
The American people do not believe Nunes can chair the committee any longer.  He is a surrogate for the WH!
"The American people." The question is who the hell do you work for? #Traitor
Even a kid like me knows you don't give the evidence to the person in question! No matter what party! #dumptrump
I guess he thinks Donald is paying his wages?@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
@effiedog @realDonaldTrump They ALL need to be reminded of that.
Clearly he thinks he works for trump the dump
he is a trump surrogate #impeachtrump
who do you think you work for?  You are the absolute worst senator this state has ever had!!
Who do u work for 
Nunez showed his true colors it is up to his committee to decide if he is trustworthy Do you believe he is ?
obviously the #AMERICAN People!
@DevinNunes Oh, @realDonaldTrump hands down. And his own self-interest of course. He should step down, IMHO
Who did you work for - Hillary or your constituents. Hillary I guess 
Nunes needs to be reminded he works for the American people, not the POTUS.
he is Donald s  puppy dog. Time to decide Devin which side do you belong. congress checks on president 4 balance
ms. Feminist who do you work for Soros or Rothschild?  Either way all yall are corrupt. Nunes an American hero
the real question is how much of what was told to Trump was told to committee as well
he likes 2 kiss his arse.
neither he works for whomever gives him the most money
Pretty stupid. All roads lead to Russia!
Nunes needs to step down or there needs to be an Independent Investigation.His stunt speaks louder than words
American people are outraged at the results of this past election and the connection to the Russians!!!
repubs don't think they work for us
exactly my point, #DevinNunes works for the #Americanpeople & we think he should resign his post.
@DoriLowry @realDonaldTrump And who do you work for Fauxcahontas? Not for the American people. U work for your crazy ego. 
@DevinNunes   Answered that yesterday by going to the WH   Needs to step Down!
wakeup...
himself!
Third option for who runs Nunes: Vladimir Putin
obviously the American people. He got the word out before u could shut him up. So you su.
In a better world, Trump would be working for the American people and this would not be an either/or
by telling the truth Nunes is working for American people unlike evading the truth Comey!
Nunes is afraid of putin!
Who do you think you work for? Jay Silverheels. #shutthefuckupliz
The American people but then again you would know that either.
Nunes behaving like a flunky, sucking up kiss a--...SYCOPHANT!!! Bet people voting for him are shocked.
not the american people thats for sure..
keep the pressure on him, Elizabeth!  #resist #ShePersisted
LOL, the cat is out of the bag now, squaw. You clowns thought you had Trump boxed in, guess again. He wins AGAIN
The orange skinned man baby for sure...he is so GREAT...said 37% of the population...2018 will be a GREAT year..
obviously he works for the orangutan
Senator Warren you don't work for the people. Hillary and Podesta have ties to Russia lets investigate.
Please keep fighting! Don't let them get away with this!
Actually he IS doing the work of the American People. Unlike you!
They all ultimately work for Putin.
Obviously, he works for #45… if he worked for me, I'd have fired him last Wednesday.
Vladimir Putin?
@JanetMoses17 @realDonaldTrump  Austin Powers would get the answer!  "Who does #2 work for?"  
Or the Russians?  They'd love the way an elected official--a committee chair!--is thumbing his nose at the US.
Both, I think! He is a true patriot! He works for his elected president, who works for the American people!
When did "Separation of Powers" in Constitution expire, as Nunes' behavior suggests?
That's pretty plain to see. He should be removed IMMEDIATELY
certainly not the people of his district, who hopefully vote him out in '18!
#SpecialProsecutor
i pose the same question to ALL reps......
@dmvaugha @realDonaldTrump depends on his mood at the time.
High time for Californians in his district to fire him!
