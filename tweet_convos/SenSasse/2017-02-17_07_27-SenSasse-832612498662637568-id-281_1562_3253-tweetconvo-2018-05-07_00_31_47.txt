the only ones not seeing it is you peepees who blindly follow a traitorous president
meanwhile your president is intent on living high off our money
He is a Mooch like the Obama"s .
In 3 weeks he has spent more than Obama did in a whole year
must be an independent investigation with facts shared with public!
I agree. Lets start that investigation right after we get done with Hillary.
Hillary isn't president!  Focus!  Pay attention to the present, it's happening right now
tweeting this is great and all, but actual action will make the difference. Your push for this can't end with a tweet.
and should you show a bravery unlike the other republicans in the senate, i would vote for you.
It doesn't matter who won or who lost; if a country tries to interfere in our election; we must find out how.
and the u.s.'s involvement in elections of other countries! See Wikileaks
Thank you--Many of us read fmr Sen Reid's warning of "burial by committee" or non-public findings. Independent Investigation only.
Problem is they are probably blackmailing him and his hands are tied.
Barack Obama illegally did more to influence 2012 election using IRS targeting than whatever Russia tried to do in '16
@BenSasse and just like that. Ben Sasse forever lost my vote.
Still waiting for that proof! Oh wait you don't have any!!!!
DO YOUR JOB
@BenSasse @OWHnews to what end? Why? Do u think anyone doesn't think they tried? What's the end goal?
Should, should, should - there are lots of SHOULD but who is investigating the issue?
I'm not voting for a Democrat next election.  That means I won't be voting for you @SenSasse.
@BenSasse @OWHnews Baghdad Johnny @SenJohnMcCain has taken Ben under his wing, grooming him to be his warmonger replacement.
Well said.  It seems you have integrity.
Country first, party second. Please see this gets an independent bipartisan investigation.
everybody is waking yo to trumpeffects. Some of them are just plain dangerous.
please support an independent investigation. Have the stamina to hold your ground.
big words from the biggest Party voter out there. #ViteHimOut
Well said.  Sasse talks the talk, but never walks the walk.  Phonier than a Chinese redhead!
I think Chaffetz needs to be investigated along with Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell. What about that?
Thank you. Seriously. From a patriot.
@20committee @OWHnews Investigation! What are virtually every member of Trumps admin rife with ties toRU?
He's afraid to, might end up with plutonium poisoning he's in so deep.He said nothing about US backed forces being bombed
Do you have any problem with Erdogan's Turkey or the Saudi's influencing us?
Push harder then!  They are obviously trying to hide something or they wouldn't try to obstruct!
@SenJoniErnst could castrate putin...snip the sexual predator & chief @realDonaldTrump, while she's at it.  #skillset
Thank you! Very concerned about Russia's interference and influence!
Then stop talking about it and do it
I agree. Russian infl & connections w/DT&team is NOT a partisan issue.Only question-do you care about America or not?
Try demonstrating it to us first
I can't tell you, and all, how important this TED by Lawrence @lessig is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2z9lV3W1g&t=910s …
Why would he do that? They're buds.
.@SenSasse @jaketapper Congress should be investigating #MSM's blatantly dishonest influence in EVERY campaign. #FakeNews #MediaLiesAgain
Amazingly everyone but FOX. We all KNOW they aren't biased.
.@PdxRick @SenSasse @jaketapper It's not about bias. Everyone has a bias. It's about BS...bogus stuff. The ones included have the most.
It is Trump who spouts th BS... bogus stuff. The media is holding his feet to the fire when he does.
.@PdxRick @SenSasse @jaketapper Yes. Nothing like pathologically dishonest "journalists" to hold elected leaders' feet to the fire.
I f you watched the press conference, Trump was caught in a blatant lie. Undeniable.
If this is true then #Trump stance makes sense.
Independent investigation is required. Congress halted important info before election. They are not to be trusted.
You are correct. Let's get a 9/11 style independent commission to investigate Russia's ties to Trump.
When have they not tried to influence our election?When have we not attempted to influence foreign elections? Grow up,
you're right senator. So what are YOU going to do about it?
.@SenSasse, please call for an independent commission to do the investigation, not a congressional one. @TruthEqualsFact
Your party's leadership has chosen party over country. McConnell and Ryan are covering up, not investigating. Make them do the job
thank you for putting country before party. Independent bipartisan investigation needed. @SenateGOP @SenateDems
and what we need is an independent investigation. You need to fight for that. Be principled, sir
completely agree and we need action, not just talk. Keep pushing to do what's right.
they can't @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan gave trump a rubber stamp. They are ineffective at best - traitors at worst
Too bad your party has tried to cover up for Trump already.
@NajvarLaw @OWHnews says a senator complicit in child rape. Hastert
@PoliticalSteve2 @OWHnews full 9/11 type investigation, nothing less #impeachtrump
Russia wants to control neighbors, destabilize Europe/NATO, & replace US as Mideast influence. We MUST get tough on them.
Don't just tell us. Lead!!!!
How about taxes, jobs and Obamacare? You are majoring in minor subjects. 2018 just around the corner! No results no vote.
Uh, yeah! influence of Clinton's campaign. Get the facts straight! Oh yeah, that's right..you work for George Soros!!
You could start by not supporting their chosen candidate, agenda, or nominees.

Stand on principle, for country over party.
on the president.
If the Clinton camp hadn't been underhanded, there wouldn't have been anything 2 leak. What she DID is what cost her
Even if Russia is involved do we have any proof they did anything other than inform the American people?
It seems like the media is just upset that some Russian hacker broke the story and did their job better than them
not "better than them" ... they are AVOIDING breaking certain stories. Have been for years.
I think it's best if Trump just stays quiet. He doesn't have the wisdom or stability to deal with Putin.
@jaketapper @OWHnews
Send her on a fact finding mission with her hog castrating knife. She doesn't seem to b adding much else to govt.
@RestoreHistory @OWHnews Me thinks you must first "sweep your own porch" first, long before worrying what others do
@mistyfoggyriver 

Partisan lens?
.@SenSasse @RestoreHistory @OWHnews The government Obama built over 8 years is filling your head with misinformation. No Russian influence.
it's about time someone says something
Good on you Senator!  Now what are YOU prepared to do about it????
You're asking the wrong person, lady.
It's already been "investigated," dude. They allegedly hacked an email server to no electoral effect. Nothing burger.
thank you for your patriotism and putting country above party!
I hear she is an expert in castration techniques, she needs to visit  Jason Chaffetz, Mitch McConnell, and Paul Ryan
I give credit when due. Thank you Senator!
@LouiseMensch @OWHnews Make it an independent investigation.Rand Paul says GOP cannot investigate GOP.
thank you senator for supporting this. I believe it needs to be investigated by an independent commission.
congress and senate should investigate the calls and who knew what when. FOX reports Trump was fully briefed.
@SheWhoVotes @OWHnews GET TOUGH? He colluded with them!
stop deflecting with tough talk on Russia and fix the problems at home. Stop being a hypocrite.
@LouiseMensch @OWHnews  Thank you, @SenSasse! This should be the opposite of partisan. You're obviously a smart guy. I knew you would lead.
@LouiseMensch @OWHnews And the public hopes ALL involved are exposed.
Please call Sessions to recuse himself from any proceedings.
Why would he do this? He is Putin's puppet
Thank you Senator.
thank you Senator.
is that the only thing you can say? North Korea /missiles, russia buzzing our ships &off shore of USA etc @Sassy__Gal @OWHnews
@pam2734 @OWHnews And, separately, a serious assessment of the president's mental health must be undertaken. PLEASE.
Why the HE double toothpick aren't you dismantling Obamacare? Nobody cares about Russia except Dems, RINOs, and MSM.
you do have some power to force the issue,Senator. Why not refuse to confirm appointees till russia hearings are held?
@jaketapper @OWHnews Agreed. But I'll believe it when I see it. You Republicans have pretty much been rolling over for 45 et. al.
even viewed through a partisan lens though it should be investigated. No reason to believe they wouldn't help other side next time
Thank you, Senator.
Yes! Please include voting systems in scope. We DON'T know if Russians hacked. Experts to @LindseyGrahamSC https://goo.gl/NK4IRf 
Congress should get some bills signed so they can be comfortable when the time for voting on impeachment comes.

Where were you elites when the Muslim/racist POTUS did not stand up to Russia or any of our other adversaries?
We urge Republicans to get tough on Trump!
@catawu @OWHnews We've been asking, Mr. Sasse. But you guys are on vacation.
thank you Senator!!it's time for Bi-Partisanship to investigate Russia, Trump and Flynn!
Get tough w Russia? Joni & friends need 2 do right thing & call for investigation. Russ influence must be stamped out!
This reeks of 'establishment' political maneuvers. We have ONE Party with two talking heads. Same snake & corrupted  @OWHnews
Frankly, I have yet to see a shred of any unlawful act by Flynn & this is exactly what Reagan did to secure Hostages  @OWHnews
@rumpfshaker Atc same time investigate why Hillary sold them our uranium and Obama on open mike said he'd do more after reelected
Ben Sasse is an embarrassment I hope Nebraska burns him after the State went for Trump.
counting on you Senator
Your party's President...and Senate. Your party's failure. @SenateMajLdr #spineless
We deserve public hearings, not GOP-led secret hearings. Please call for Select Committee or Independent 9/11-type Commission.
I applaud u for speaking out. But please go further. Our democracy is in the hands of GOP patriots like u.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/a-party-to-the-russian-connection.html?smid=tw-share …
Wish  you put as much effort  into defeating the democratic  party as you do President  Trump!
THANK YOU for putting the welfare of ALL Americans before party.  That's a patriot!
@DeeStarInNJ @OWHnews Let's see an independent transparent investigation, 9/11 commission style
I hope I am reading this right. If so, thanks Sen. Sasse #MakeAmericaSecureAgain
@SenJohnMcCain If citizens wanted this we would be talking about #glassceilings & #PotusHillaryClinton
Russian interference does need to be investigated. We would also still like to see @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns-
Thank you, Senator Sasse. A nonpartisan, independent commission is a great idea.
@mindyfinn @OWHnews Thank you, Senator!
@mindyfinn all this goes away if someone who is in legislation legit calls the Admin. Communists and backs it up
Must have an Independent Special prosecutor. Otherwise, you're just bullshitting America.
@BenSasse @OWHnews #please
You have plenty of leverage over Trump and McConnell that you choose not to exert.  Start or this is just grandstanding
@BenSasse @MortonOWH you are absolutely correct. Both parties should agree that an independent investigation necessary.
Another reason @SenSasse is my favourite GOP senator.
This should not be viewed through partisan labels. Congress should investigate Russia’s influence campaign in the US http://www.omaha.com/news/nation/nebraska-iowa-lawmakers-urge-trump-to-get-tough-with-russia/article_7858a685-20c7-5ea0-adb7-9402fe287aed.html …
@BenSasse @OWHnews thank you
Do you support a public and bi-partisan investigation of the Trump team's ties to Russia?
Thank you! Refusal to reveal truth allows further division & erosion of our institutions! Terrorism in any form is unwelcome here.
Thank you for this.
Good idea.  Let's start a war with Russia.
We have enough problems and fires to put out without creating others. We need Russia to wipe out ISIS, end of story.
I AGREE and voters will remember.
@jaketapper @OWHnews you're such a tool.
Thank you for standing for what is right and prudent.  Wish @ChuckGrassley would start doing the same.  TY too,@SenJoniErnst
Oh please. There's no ill wind that doesn't blow opportunistic Sasse good. You should have stood up to Trump earlier.
good on you, sir.
will you also investigate the Obama regime meddling in Israel's & France's elections?
good Lord ..DNC was aLEAK, exposed corruption, REAL corruption..Russia is distraction
people are too smart to continue buying their stories.
independent committee not a intelligence committee where they can continue with the lying
LOL!! You're still harping on this?? LOL!  OMG! Desperate times call for desperate investigations I guess.
@jaketapper @OWHnews This is nothing new, Russia has been a bad actor for decades, we should always investigate but stop hysteria
.@aeikenberry @SenSasse from your lips to McConnell 's ears, Senator.
Yeah, right...and I'd like to see Jesus at the breakfast table telling me Trump is not as bad as he seems.
AGREED! RUSSIA ATTACKING AMERICA IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE - WE SHOULD UNITE AND FIGHT BACK!
Thank you!
Ben Sasse is the man.
Still just talk - put forth a bill to accomplish that. Until then it's just Sasse being Sasse.
can you tell that to @SenateMajLdr he's hiding in his shell avoiding the topic. What does Russia have on him
We've known about the #fakenews since last year. #corruptmedia http://magafeed.com/wikileaks-dnc-planning-trumprussia-ties-since-april/ …
America, world urge lawmakers to get tough with Trump

http://www.omaha.com/news/nation/nebraska-iowa-lawmakers-urge-trump-to-get-tough-with-russia/article_7858a685-20c7-5ea0-adb7-9402fe287aed.html … @SenSasse @OWHnews
This is the first time I am agreeing with Joni Ernst but needs to do more. Grassley and King can f*** off.
@jaketapper @OWHnews Gotta do something, because your ag economy's gonna be trashed. Better late than never to the right thing.
Thank you so much @SenSasse. I'd also love to see an independent investigation into campaign communications with Russia.
@jaketapper @OWHnews We look forward to you telling @SenMajLeader that you won't support anything until an investigation ordered.
since when does the perp enable their own trial?
yes. Thank you! Keep reading @20committee and @LouiseMensch!
And The Clintons for being part of influencing it.
@jaketapper @OWHnews Democrats always creating a problem where one doesn't exist. Creating the wound and supplying the bandage.
Thank you Senator. Now THAT is statesmanlike.
What do you want him to do, start a war? POTUS didn't create Russia issues he inherited them He's done nothing but discuss options
@20committee @OWHnews  glad to see there's SOMETHING you won't rubber stamp.
but political posturing won't keep America safe. It won't prevent a hostile covert coup of our democracy. Truth will
this is the method used by cons media to spin disturbing facts - adhere to partisan accusations rather than the facts
this report provides a false equivalency between those who accuse media of "assassinating" Flynn & truth seekers
Russia had nothing to do with our election.
Obama in his next 2 last presser at 50 min mark said there was NO Russian hack of the election vote at all...
Tell that to your Rep. colleagues in the Senate and House, Senator.  The rest of us know it.
thank you for your integrity
Oh yeah, I remember- the traitorous US neocon clique wants to steal resource wealth from Putin's neighborhood.
Why would anyone think its OK to mess w/ Russia in their own backyard?  What business do we have provoking ?
This = why you're regarded as #fakenews Jake. Stop looking under rocks for ghosts & cover crimes in the open
Beats the hell out of dissolving the NEA.
thank you for putting country first. Glad to see there are Republicans who know what is most important.
so get to it Ben! your party is blocking the investigation
@20committee @OWHnews @SenJoniErnst This new Tough Guy stance after blessing Tillerson rings very hollow. We aren't stupid.
trump won't get tough! He benefited from Russian interference!
Need independent investigation
@20committee @OWHnews Thank you Senator!
@20committee @MortonOWH Thank you Senator Sasse! @SenJoniErnst
@20committee @OWHnews thank you, not partisan #patriot
