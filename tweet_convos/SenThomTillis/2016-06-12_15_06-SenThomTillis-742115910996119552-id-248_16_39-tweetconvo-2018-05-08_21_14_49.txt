Did you or did you not vote to kill a Senate bill that would have prevented those on the watch list from purchasing firearms?
@BackwardNC @SenThomTillis He DID:
As usual Democrats try to blame guns Did Gov hire terrorist as armed security guard?Failure
Are terrorist doing the killing & is it Gov doing the hiring Did Feds Mess Up
Shut up! @Roberta1836 @DonnaDraughon @BackwardNC @NC_N8 @SenThomTillis
The truth is Those trying to turn acts of violence into Agenda of Democrats Unreal
No, Juanita. The agenda is guns. You're trying to make it political. @Roberta1836 @DonnaDraughon @BackwardNC @NC_N8
ISIS? This was American homegrown homophobia that legally bought a tool for mass murder with our lax gun control policies.
.@SenThomTillis I'm sorry but I have a hard time believing a republican NC politician really cares about what happens to gay people.
He may not like the views of the people killed, but he can care about people being killed.
You seriously just liked your own tweet?
Hillary fan huh?
Funny thing is, I am not a Trump fan. I am not a fan of any liar. Especially Hillary.
You took MILLIONS from #NRA, HYPOCRITE. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW. End #NRA chokehold on Americans! #filibuster #holdthefloor
.@SenThomTillis remember when you voted against a bill that would prevent terrorists from buying guns?
.@SenThomTillis so in your statement you didn't mention guns or LGBT. Just wanted you to know.
He also didn't mention that he voted to make it easier for terrorists to buy guns. #hypocrite #Orlando
but WHAT are you going to do to prevent tragedies like this from occurring again? #EndGunViolence
so now you give a shit?!
Come on. You're just glad it was in Florida not NC. If you cared you would act for equality for all.
Please change your mind and end gun violence. The Orlando tragedy is on you and everyone else who doesn't want gun control.
#Enough Stop taking @NRA money + support gun control measures, this hate crime is on your hands
.@SenThomTillis Maybe action then, not just thoughts & prayers, are necessary. Or is it just educators who get evaluated for DOING our job?
way to go!  Yay for your sympathy and for your pitiful pandering to NRA.  Not representing me well.  #thanksforsucking
@SenatorBurr  OMG! Stop praying and do something! How much does the NRA pay for your inaction? #filibuster #holdthefloor
.@SenThomTillis why hasnt God answered all of the prayers after every mass shooting? maybe you forgot to do the work #EndGunViolence #Enough
Your prayers mean nothing when you voted against common sense gun laws in December 2015.
your thoughts and prayers could've meant something if you'd use your power to prevent stuff like this from happening
thoughts and prayers wont undo you voting to allow people on the terrorist watch list to buy assault rifles
all well and good to put out a statement, but what are you actually going to do to keep NC safe? Say no to more NRA $$??
How dare you pretend sympathy when you vote to keep guns unregulated!
instead of praying, donate the money you took from the NRA to a LBGT cause. In all honesty, your voting record is shameful.
.@SenThomTillis your prayers are not #enough. Pls cross the aisle, join @ChrisMurphyCT, & take action NOW against gun violence
Prayers are great, but they won't stop people from killing. Taking away the guns that give them the ability to kill will.
Remember, No Knee Jerk Gun Legislation. Leave the 2nd Amendment alone. Without the 2nd there is no 1st.
@SenThomTillis
Save your BS and do something about the guns.
@SenThomTillis
@SenThomTillis
how much more blood will you have on your hands because of NRA $$?!?
stop letting the NRA and it's cronies rule! Listen to your constituents!
Baloney.  You encourage this activity by your voting record.
Your prayers are falling on non existence ears. Do something to strengthen gun control, empty platitudes mean nothing.
prayers mean nothing when your VOTES give terrorists access to deadly weapons. @MomsDemand #Orlando
@SenThomTillis
Stop praying for them,don't get to treat gays as second class citizens, work to take away their rights, then feign concern
pray the @Nra keeps giving u you checks to cash
You helped cause this.
we see you now senator for who you are. An enemy to the country and everything we hold dear. POS
unless you work against #hate & lack of #gunsense keep your prayers to yourself because that's only one helped Matthew 6:5
When Gun control happens then prayers for victims has meaning. Or JUST pray to NRA for more money. Your God NRA $$$$
I assume your heart also goes out to the NRA who would have lost a few dollars in profits had you voted for gun reform.
DO something. Every republican voted no on a law that would have stopped this guy from owning a gun. Gun reform now!
How can you pray with your hands shoved so deep in the NRA's pockets?  For shame.
I would not call the 1st responders brave.The 1st officer yes. But waiting 3 hrs while 90 people are being shot isn't brave
you better pray ! Cause those Pearly gates aren't going to open up for you
Interesting that you didn't once mention guns, LGBTQ, or the fact that you're a spineless coward bought by @NRA.
How about you give the NRA back the $2,459,881 they gave you?
your prayers are meaningless without action for sensible gun control laws. Faith without works is dead.
@SenThomTillis
how much more blood will you have on your hands because of NRA $$?!?
you've taken nearly $2.5 million from @NRA. Your prayers are hollow.
what a disgusting man. I was heartbroken when you won your Senate seat and this is why
you and your republican friends disgust me! Cannot wait to vote you out!
stop putting the NRA and it's cronies rule! Listen to your constituents!
do not claim to be praying for the victims. DO SOMETHING to make sure this can't happen!
hypocrite!!! You voted against a bill that could have prevented this man from getting this assault weapon
Here's a good sign you are wrong: If you have to tiptoe to avoid  stepping on your own positions while condemning the attacks
do you eat with the same mouth through which you pass such hypocrisy?  #Orlando #PulseShooting
You have blood on your hands.
. @SenThomTillis Your prayers mean NOTHING. Nothing. You are part of the problem, you make me sick, and I'll be voting you out in November.
Taking a $2.4 million bribe from the NRA 2 vote against making it harder 4 terrorists to get guns is an act of evil...yours.
.@SenThomTillis You are a NRA shill and the blood is on YOUR hands!
You have worked to advance homophobia and transphobia in this nation. You breed hate. You are the problem.
maybe if you hadn't received $2,459,881 in expenditures from the NRA, you would have been able to prevent this. Pig.
We don't want or need your prayers. You took donations from the NRA to allow guns to flood our towns. This is on you.
Instead of praying, how about taking action to prevent it from happening to anyone else? Takes more effort than tweeting.
@SenThomTillis
SHAME!! You've taken $2.5M from #NRA & voted against banning people on terror watch list from buying firearms. SHAME!!!
I pray that you stop your criminal behaviour which causes innocent deaths every other day
All these Republican sleazes Who took money frm NRA have these ppl's blood on their hands. I guess 2M will buy lots of soap
too bad you voted against making it harder for terrorists like this to buy guns. #shame
.@SenThomTillis #ThoughtsAndPrayers mean nothing. 
$2.5M of #NRA money = $50k per life. 
That's how much you value life, your 30 pieces.
Keep your stone cold heart and your hypocritical prayers 2yourself. God knows you don't give a damn abt anything but NRA $$$.
They are. They take the $$ &do whatever NRA tells them2 &guns go2 hateful cowards who're afraid of shadows
$2.4M. WoW! You are the worst type of human.
We're reminded of your true character as you ensure that the likes of Mateen have unfettered access to assault weapons.
What are you doing to protect the group that was targeted by these attacks? Or to prevent these attacks?
stop praying and do something, Thom. You have the power to do so.
Another @NRA stooge with "thoughts and prayers" for yet more victims of assault rifles, this one on the FBIs radar. Shameless
did you run this statement by Lapierre before you sent it out?  He's your daddy
You took over $2,000,000 from the NRA.  Your condolences and prayers are empty and hollow.  How do you sleep at night?
Stop praying. DO! 1. #Stoptakingmoney from @NRA 2. Make it harder 4 mentally ill to get #guns (or do #votes matter >lives?)
But you'll fight like a tiger to get these weapons in as many hands as possible. Gotta keep NRA contributions rolling in.
The time for prayers is over. The time to get these military grade murder weapons off our streets is NOW!
HOW ABOUT GUN CONTROL? WE DON'T NEED ACCESS TO ASSAULT WEAPONS THOM! #dotherightthing
..@SenThomTillis
@susantillis   It is very hard to respect anything that comes out of your mouth.  Cintra Contract-  needs canceling
You got over 2 mil from the NRA to block gun legislation.  You are partially responsible for 50 dead and many wounded.
you do more harm than good with your false prayers.
says the man taking over $2m in payola from the NRA and blocking critical legislation #shameoncongress
stop playing fucknigga u voted against a bill to make those on watchlist harder to get guns. Stop playing fuckboi.
how did you vote on past bills to make it more difficult for watchlist individuals to get guns?  Were you for or against?
prayer is not enough sir!  As a NC citizen, I urge you to put forth legislature that will ban assault rifles
You, sir, are a two-faced liar who has been paid well to enable the NRA at every turn and prevent any common sense solutions!
but how do you feel about people who hate LBGTQ people & make it acceptable to hate them by couching it in "religion"
Coward
. @SenThomTillis prayers alone aren’t working, how about stop working for the NRA and start working for us!
We don't want your thoughts and prayers. We want change.
maybe a little more than thoughts and prayers are needed, senator. like action, perhaps? legislation?
you pray for God to do something every time, why don't you do something other than take money from the NRA.
James 2:14-26
Faith Without Works Is Dead
Your words are meaningless unless you DO something to make the situation better.
blah blah blah
SELLOUT
http://reverbpress.com/politics/nra-pays-senators-millions/ …
got $2,459,881 in expenditures from @NRA & voted against making it harder for terrorists to get guns
how about you continue and continue to pray while tragedies like these keep happening. the people want change.
then do something about this easy access to guns.  Military style guns are not needed on the streets
put your money where your mouth is. Hollow statements do nothing when you have the ability to affect change with gun laws.
You're bought and paid for by the @NRA. #Deleteyouraccount
What prayers? You Sir are a hypocrite.
. @SenThomTillis what are you going to do improve gun control? Please limit access to automatic weapons! #yourconstituentspeaking #Orlando
please pass common sense gun reforms supported by majority of voters.
"We are really sad that someone took our hateful rhetoric seriously & acted on it.  Join me in pretending I'm not complicit!"
Is the deaths of those 50 people worth the 2.5 mil you took from the NRA? What's it like to have that blood on your hands?
You weren't praying for them when it came to the bathrooms, your bloody NRA hand sure aren't praying now.
keep your thoughts and prayers to yourself until you give back the $2.4 million you took from the NRA.
Then do something about it. So far you have enabled such acts with your votes.Introduce a bill that does more than condolence
Please spend less time praying and more time doing your job as a senator to pass laws that will protect our citizens.
amen to that 
sold your soul
Fuck you.
Your words are meaningless until you pass real gun reform and stop lining your pockets with NRA money #enough
Your prayers are not enough.
how much money have you taken from the NRA?
You took over $2 million from the NRA and voted against laws that would make it harder for terrorists to get guns. Hypocrite.
COMPLICIT - your 2million from the NRA puts blood on your hands - no one wants your prayers - murderer
Hey @SenThomTillis WHY DONT U ENACT SENSIBLE GUN LAWS instead of praying. In case u didn't know, UR in a position to DO something!!
$2.4M from the gun lobby certainly speaks to your sincerity
What more do you have to offer? http://whatever.scalzi.com/2016/06/12/thoughts-and-prayers/ …
What did you do with the millions you got from @NRA?
how does praying help? Maybe some action such as tougher gun laws
Your prayers are meaningless when you took $2.5million from the NRA to block the Bill  Shame on you sir.
u can't undo what you've done to afford shooters opportunities like this, so what r U going to do about it now? #prevent
You took money from NRA to support Islamic Terrorism. Shame on you!
Thoughts and Prayers? Is that all? http://whatever.scalzi.com/2016/06/12/thoughts-and-prayers/ …
got $2,459,881 in expenditures from @NRA & voted against making it harder for terrorists to get guns @igorvolsky
NRA Whore.
author of ammendment One and you want us to believe you feel any sympathy for the LGBT community? #howstupiddoyouthinkweare
NRA money and blood on your hands.
the 2M you have taken from the NRA = blood on your hands
yeah..and I'm sure you prayed after Sandy Hook and San Bernardino too stop praying and DO SOMETHING!!
you are subhuman trash. you are a most vile piece of shit
This would be easier to swallow if you weren't sitting so firmly in the NRA's deep pockets.
In addition to praying, how about strengthening #guncontrol laws so it's harder to commit murders? #Orlando #PulseNightclub
If you can take a break from praying for just a moment, try leading instead
You took $2.5 million from NRA & vote against LGBT civil rights. Your actions have consequences. You are to blame for this.
@vickscan @SenThomTillis
valuing NRA $ over public safety makes you complicit in the death of every victim in Orlando. Do America a favor & resign.
Thoughts & Prayers are NOT enough!
A duplicitous Christian. What else is new? As long as it doesn't happen to your family, the $ is good.
Don't need your thoughts and prayers. We need you to stop being an NRA lapdog & address unfettered access to assault rifles.
Why do Republicans support terrorist getting military weapons? Why won't Republicans keep citizens protected from guns?
how about some legislation to stop suspected terrorists from buying military weapons?
.@SenThomTillis I'm telling you guys, this dude is such a scam. Always has been. Nothing new.
@mms5048 @SenThomTillis We know him as Thom Titless. Worthless also too
You supported NC's unconstitutional ban on same sex marriage & accept millions from the @NRA your prayers are empty & useless
You got $2.4 million from the NRA. What would it cost to buy your vote for sensible gun laws that would save lives? #gunsense
#BANTHEM @SenThomTillis 
#PulseNightclub 
#PulseShooting 
#PulseMassacre
You support bills that provide free access to military weapons & demonize the #LGBT community. Where is your support for us?
Please do something to #EndGunViolenceNOW
Praying wont bring back the dead. Banning all weapons will maybe save lives. Stop pretending to care, GOP asshole.
#voteforguncontrol
Your prayers are not stopping mass shootings. If they did, we wouldn't be on shooting #176 for the year. #GunControl
Send the $2.4M you rec'd from the @NRA to the #Orlando families who lost loved ones in the #PulseShooting.
@BackwardNC @SenThomTillis @NRA great idea Thom, $2.4M is better than your meaningless "prayers"

.@SenThomTillis got $2,459,881 in expenditures from @NRA & voted against making it harder for terrorists to get guns https://twitter.com/SenThomTillis/status/742115910996119552 …
You don't care.
Those are some expensive prayers. A whole $2.4mil worth... #Orlando
