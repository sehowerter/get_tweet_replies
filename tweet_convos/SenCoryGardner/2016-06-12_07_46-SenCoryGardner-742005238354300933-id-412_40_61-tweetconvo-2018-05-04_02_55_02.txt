then do something about it!!!!!
Would be better if the #GOP stopped arming domestic terrorists. #filibuster Also the #GOP & NRA should pay for 49 funerals
It's hard to believe your "heart aches" when you vote consistently to ensure they can be shot then take $5K from NRA.
Stand strong with our 2nd Amendment! Ban PRESSER COOKERS!!
Then do something about it, Senator. We're tired of dying. #enough Join the #filibuster Make actual laws to protect us.
.@SenCoryGardner It would be great if you acknowledged the #lgbt and #latino communities - we are not invisible.
Dear @SenCoryGardner, I have tried to call but voice mail not taking calls last night & today your phone just keeps ringing with no answer.
Maybe you could do something more as a legislator.
You are responsible of their deaths. Stop acting like you care about their lives when you care more about your money. #nra
seems from this list of tweets you do not vote to represent your constituents. More here for better laws than against.
it's time to support this with action. You represent me, please help w/ the #filibuster and #holdthefloor to #EndGunViolence
liar.
Actions speak louder than words. #saveyourprayers
Mourning is not enough. Support S 551 and Brady Bill 2.0
How about some comprehensive gun control? Or recognizing that homophobia kills? DO SOMETHING! #James217
Prayers aren’t bringing them back.  Nor will it bring back the innocence and joys of youth for those who are left behind. Shame on you.
we need more than the ache of your heart, Senator. What are you going to do to prevent future tragedies?
you can pray for their families but voted against a bill that would have helped prevent something like this? Pick a side
- you should try doing something USEFUL instead.  Like voting for mandatory background checks.  #AshamedToBeInYourDistrict
I can't wait until you get voted out of office. Your vote today is absolutely fucking despicable. You should be ashamed.
We in CO are FOR gun sense.....when will u come to ur senses? My thoughts n prayers will be for ur one term! Do your job!
please please please support tighter gun laws!
Was Columbine not enough...the Aurora shooting.  Can't stopa M-1 Abrams tank with an AR15, but can't kill a bunch of people.
You don't get to mourn. The complicit don't get to offer false condolences and fake sentiments. You did this, Cory.
@!micahsgrrl Ricky the Senator might say you can't put a price on human life but his job is worth 1.5 mill Priorities
If prayer worked, this shit would have ended long ago
Do something you sanctimonious jerk 
Ban autoloaders w/big mags
stop taking money from the NRA & do something. Prays don't fix bullet holes. Did your prays work after last mass shooting?
Mourning and praying aren't enough - do something about it in the Senate so this type of tragedy never happens again.
Mourning and praying don't help. Gun control legislation does.
@puppymnkey @cpm5280 @SenCoryGardner This says it all! And you Repubs, if the shoe fits!!!!!
take action if you feel bad. Sensible gun laws. NRA pocket must be a comfortable place.
Keep mourning and praying cuz the next one is just around the corner with help from you and the Guns Over People party.
Then please make CO @MomsDemand proud and vote 4 universal background checks and closing the terror gap. #DisarmHate #Enough
We need to vote these Senators out of office. #Orlando #Gunsense
Do you have that backward? They're the ones keeping America safe from those who would hand it to terrorists
GOP blocks bill to stop terrorists from buying guns http://on.msnbc.com/1TpJ6Vt  @msnbc
A list that included 10 year olds, US Senator, and TSA employees with no due process? But not Orlando shooter?
If u don't believe in drawing common sense lines should we all be able to buy nukes?
Also every time a #gunsense grabber says "common sense" we know they're full of shit. Next up: "AR15 is military"
.@SenCoryGardner As my elected senator, I'm holding you personally responsible to take action and prevent gun violence.
Why you dont fight agtainst ISLAM Migration
Oh, FFS. Go away.
realy i am from a moslem nation (kosovo) believe me they hate gay people. Hatred is all what they have.
then vote to close gun loophole #enough #terrorgap
your words are hollow and meaningless. Will you be returning the $1.5 to the #NRA? Will you ever value our lives over power?
your words mean NOTHING until you vote for stricter gun regulations!  You have blood on your hands  for taking NRA money!
I would be honored if you would listen to this perspective on the need for action.
This may not have happened if stricter gun laws were in place. Stand up to the NRA to ban assault weapons.
. @SenCoryGardner mhmm...
Your "praying" will not help. You voted AGAINST gun control legislation. You voted for those people to be killed.
YOU had a chance to vote to prohibit people on the FBI's terror watch list from obtaining guns and you voted against it.
if your heart actually aches VOTE TO BAN CIVILIANS FROM OWNING ASSAULT RIFLES. Imagine all of the lives you could save.
aka - Jamie and I are counting the money we took to guarantee simple Universal background checks don't exist
take your prayers to the bank if they are so meaningful and get out of bed with the NRA!  #DisgracefulDisloyalUnAmerican
.@SenCoryGardner I think this is why we have separation of church & state.  Nothing worse than fake "concern."  #DoYourJob not NRAs bidding.
They must not ache enough to take action. Please DO SOMETHING about it so these kinds of things cease to happen.
prayers and thoughts don't do anything unless you actually start doing your job and fight for much better gun laws
Enough of your hypocritical mourning and "prayers."  You have blood on your hands.
Give back the $1.5 to the NRA and ban assault weapons. Lives lost and wounded aren't worth it now, are they?
why have u accepted thousands of $ in donations from the NRA? Why did you reject the 2013 background checks bill?#Orlando
Don't mourn the Orlando victims...do something useful to prevent the next mass shooting, sir!
But the nearly $4 million from the NRA your campaign has benefitted makes your prayers pretty empty.
If that's all you CAN do, that's a SHAME, but if that's all you WILL do, then that's a SIN, isn't it?  #BloodyHands
then why did you vote no and allowed terrorists to purchase guns?? 50 lives lost because you voted no.
I hope the $1.5 million from the NRA will help you ease your heart ache.
over $3 mill from the NRA says you don't give a crap about those lives lost.
then why did you vote against HR 1076 denying firearms to terrorists?  #coloradocitizen #policiesnotprayers
Needed: background checks, strict licensing, no guns for terror/no-fly lists. CO knows the pain ORL feels. TAKE ACTION!
The only thing we need from you is common sense gun legislation. Do your job, sir.
Imrprove gun laws, get out of NRA's pocket.
you can stop this kind of violence by voting for banning assault weapons especially for those on the No Fly List..Shameful!
You voted AGAINST preventing suspected terrorists from
gun purchases AND accepted $849,964 from NRA. Mourn & pray, ha!!!!!
your aching heart is worthless. your constituents want reform and change. you have the power to actually DO something. do it
u blocked sensible gun control efforts after Sandy Hook. As US Senator u can be a force of good the world, but choose not to
Your words mean NOTHING @SenCoryGardner. You are a slave to the @NRA. You are complicit in this madness. You are part of the problem.
So you're giving back money the NRA has given you? Have integrity. Don't pretend to care when you are the cause.DO SOMETHING
delete your account
U r storing NRA riches on earth. That's where ur heart is. That's a Bible reference. Ur votes show US where ur heart is too.
As someone who does bidding of @NRA, you're an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Actions speak louder than prayers.
Cory, you voted NO on prohibiting ppl on terror watch list from buying guns. Your prayers r hypocritical and God knows it.
I'm sure you made the same statement for every mass shooting.   Isn't it time to do something other than give condolences?  @SenCoryGardner
Your prayers and heartache are meaningless. You are complicit. GUN REFORM NOW. #Orlando
are you? Are you really because you had a hand in this tragedy.
How can you rep CO, the site of Columbine and Aurora shootings, are do nothing about gun control? Is NRA $ > innocent lives?
Y won't u acknowledge that the LGBT community was attacked? Don't depoliticize their deaths when you politicize their lives.
Prayers are great, Senator. How about some actual political action to stop this, though?
I guess their lives are worth less than 4 million dollars
With respect to your position, you voted against legislation that would have kept the killer from buying his assault rifle.
You voted on 12/2 015 against law to block people on terror watchlist from buying guns. You are directly responsible
.@SenCoryGardner Given your voting record, I find your sudden concern for LGBQT people unbelievable and disgusting.
I Hold you personally responsible for failing to keep the offending weapon out of tis criminals hands. Your prayers = ZERO
and what you're going to do about it? Take more money from the NRA? Shame on you and your hypocrisy
as a CO resident, I'm horrified that you took $$ from @NRA
CO has a painful history with guns. We need new policy, please!
You oppose gays rights and loyally follow the orders of the NRA. Ergo you will do nothing.
Save your prayers and crocodile tears for your friends. It's people like you responsible for this.
You got 1.5 million from NRA & voted AGAINST a bill that would stop suspected terrorists buying guns. Save your fake pity.
Hypocrite #lawsnotprayers #DoYourJob
You're not fooling anyone, senator. You could have helped to stop this a few shootings ago.
.@SenCoryGardner are you waiting until this type of event comes to CO before taken sensible legislative action and positions on it?!
prayers for the victims in Orlando will not bring you forgiveness for taking $1.5m  @NRA blood money. #AsGuiltyAsTheKiller
.  What did you do to prevent it?  Absolutely nothing.
Senator MY heart aches b/c YOU took > $1MILLION from NRA. No one needs this military killing machinery. DO something abt it.
@SenCoryGardner
If only you had some sort of way to change policy. Like a vote or something. http://everytown.org/senate-votes/ 
instead of praying, you could push policy change on guns. Praying hasn't stop gun massacres.
52 likes, Senator. Try again.
Quit your false mourning. Your heart is filled with NRA $$ and you are a coward who won't vote to protect your own citizens.
You got 1,555,000 from the NRA to buy your vote.  You are a shameful, greedy person and a really rotten American.
Smile.. you fence riding.. #NraPuppet ..
.@SenCoryGardner As a Colorado resident, please shut your trap unless you actually care about ending the violence!
not enough. What are you going to DO?
Stop taking the @NRA's dirty money and start saving lives. Prayer is passive. Take action. Be a leader.
You received $1,544,783 from @NRA.You're not going to take any action to make sure this doesn't happen again.
just words senator that ring hollow.  you could help pass commons sense gun laws but you won't because you want that NRA $$$
Its no accident that we have by FAR the highest gun death rate in the developed world.
How about you actually do something to PREVENT gun violence and stop people from getting such deadly guns!
Sadly you are a mistake we in CO elected. Good thing come 2020 we get to vote you and your 1.5 million from @NRA
Your prayers and heartache are meaningless. You are complicit. GUN REFORM NOW. #Orlando
You can't take gun lobby money and still'ache' for the victims. Blood on your hands.
keep our rights alive.
.@SenCoryGardner this would be far more believable if you hadn't voted with anti-LGBTQ @FRCdc 100% of the time...
@SenCoryGardner
@SenCoryGardner
please pass common sense gun regulations supported by majority of Americans to end gun violence epidemic.
Hypocrite! You are "praying" because it's politically expedient. You don't give a crap about these people.  @SenCoryGardner
.@SenCoryGardner America is SICK of your thoughts and prayers. Do something to #stopgunviolence or get voted out. #NoMoreExcuses #NotOneMore
does this mean you're going to start voting for gun control and LGBT+ rights? #dontjusttalkthetalk #Orlando
sleep tonight with all the blood that you have on your hands along with the @nra $$$$
how much NRA money do you have?
We dont need your phony prayers when you've taken over $1.5 MILLION from the NRA. #gunsense @SenCoryGardner
Your hypocrisy is disgusting. If you do have faith, how do you live with yourself?
Prayers without action from legislators who can make a difference are offensive to God and man.  You sold out for NRA cash.
$1.5MM from NRA. Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless. You need to man up and act on tightening background checks.
You, unfortunately are my do nothing Senator. Pray AND DO SOMETHING you jerk!!!!!!
The absolute shame I feel that you represent my great state. Your false words mock decency.
Action numnutz Action!
Your mourning doesn't help! While you are mourning more AR-15's with banana clips are falling into mentally ill hands!
shame on you for all the money you have taken from nra
LIAR!
Ban the AR-15!
.@SenCoryGardner - you should have voted for expanded background checks in December.
.@SenCoryGardner then stop taking @nra money. https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recips.php?id=D000000082&type=P&cycle=2014&sort=A&state=CO …
Your prayers count for precisely zero.
How long did you really pray Senator?
Your condolences are meaningless because you won't DO anything to help & you could. #immoral #GunControl #Insulted #Orlando
.@SenCoryGardner You own direct responsibility for this heinous act. You've sold us out for money. All these deaths are on your hands. Shame
Based on the responses to your tweet, clearly you do not work for the people when you refuse to support gun legislation. $$$
nice job with that vote tho
thank you. Any words of solidarity for @jaredpolis who can't donate blood today? Or hope Congress will make #gunsense?
- For @1.4 Million from the @NRA you now have their blood on your hands.
do your job.  Protect your citizens.
That $1,544,783  from the NRA suggests otherwise. DO YOUR JOB.
.@SenCoryGardner Your mourning means nothing. By taking $3.9M from NRA & voting against gun control, you're complicit in #Orlando massacre.
offering prayers is simply a lazy way of saying you are too cowardly to address the issue yourself.
"our hearts ache but our wallets are spilling over with $1.5 mil in NRA blood money! So it kind of all balances out I think"
I just wonder what your words really mean. you mourn and pray for the lost in Orlando. what you should be is ashamed.
how about stop taking money from the NRA and start protecting our people? Prayers aren't gonna do it.
I mean, if 20 dead kids at Newtown won't change your mind and 50 dead adults, maybe $$$ will?
