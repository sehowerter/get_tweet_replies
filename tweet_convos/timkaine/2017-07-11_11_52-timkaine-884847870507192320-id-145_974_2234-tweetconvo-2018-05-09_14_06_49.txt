I called @marcorubio this morning. #SaveACA
Like your son ... inciting violence and riots ... yippee
Thank God I live in MI w/ 2 Democrat Senators!!
WE made R voices heard loud & clear Nov 8th.when we elected Pres Trump.U corrupt Dems had a shot at health care & BLEW IT,ANYTHING is better
Pass #Trumpcare!!!
Calling all obstructionist!  U put politics & party above taxpayers & issues.  Calling 4 people who agree w/ your disagreement, serves none!
Find u a rock to crawl under and take HRC with you sir.
Ameeica certainly heard your voice last year 
How can anyone trust what he is doing or saying? He wants us to continue to stick us with Obama care? Its not working, its failing!
I think you need to learn what treason means. Lordy you hold an office position??? And you don't know what treason means?
I thought the Dems don't know what's in the bill, so neither do your followers, yet y'all are hell bent on defeating it? What's the reason?
Senator Tim Kaine@timkaine I'm embarrassed that you rep our state and don't know what constitutes treason in this country.#Plz get informed!
Tim.... You and Hillary lost. Get over it
You have enough to worry about in own backyard.  ppl rejected your lies, hypocrisy, and cronyism! #FlyOverStates
I wish you were my Senator. My Sens in NC REFUSE to see or hear from any of their constituents. You're always there for Virginians. Thanks!
Have you been huffin' varnish?
No, have you?
Yes, don't pass any heath care bill and let moslem care fall apart, it's well on it's way.  Perfect plan as far as I see.
Yes! The #LightUpTheLOVE Global Movement inspires the action needed to create love, peace & unity! It's what the world needs now! #LUTL 
Inciting treason
And everyone in favor of dumping the money pit known as Obamacare will also continue to make their voices heard, LOUD and CLEAR!
What if u aren't opposed to it? Should those people not speak up? Do u represent all people or just the ones who agree with ur agenda?
I'm opposed to you Democrats & liberals turning the country into a circus! Shame on all of you!
So tired of the in fighting in DC. I live in Virginia, next election I voting all Republican. Glad your not VP.
Before Obamacare I paid about $35 a week for medical. I now pay $140 a week with a higher deductable. Cant Washington get it together??
Vote no on republican health care plan!
Remember I already KNOW the answer..so if you don't answer you'll receive a FOIA and other legal requests that  you legally must answer!
Question ANY time in you political career did you look for or willing receive info that was bad for your opponent that u used? Answer yes/no
Take ur sorry ass elsewhere, while u can do it WITHOUT HELP!
Say WHAT? Ur asking America to go against Potus? Hahaha.
As a VA resident, I ask for your continued opposition to this cruel bill that will leave 22million uninsured.
Every time you senators speak the American people realize how ignorant and self serving you are & how you only care about yourselves not us
What is your solution, Tim?
please vote to repeal the current ACA....please hear my voice @MarkWarner
You mean like your sons, resisting arrest and disrupting the 'free speech' of Americans? You can't control your kids, but keep trying US smh
What about those who support it?!?!  We r Americans too!!!

Treason
Kill the bill before it kills us!

We need everyone who lost insurance due to high premiums to make your voices heard loud and clear! Call your senators!
America is done with Liberalism. 
You sold us out to Globalism, take a long walk and never return you POS!
Say NO to the *joker* and his libtard #fakeinformation.. Obama care is failing.. let it CRASH and let the Dems be exposed for their failure!
Well we were opposed to Obamacare from the start and you didn't listen then did you ?
Thank you! My husband has stage 4 kidney cancer.  We buy insurance on exchange and drive to Duke every 2 wks for treatment.  It's important!

Yawn
I'm going to start calling it #PutinCare
Thank you, Sen. The GOP bill is wealthcare, not healthcare, it is cruel and inhumane.  The process has lacked transparency that we deserve.
Where is your proof of this? Can we see it?
Make it loud, make it clear, WE DON'T WANT YOUR TERRORIST SON HERE!
You really don't care to hear what the majority of us in Virginia think about it, just those who oppose it? 11k out of how many Virginians?
I wrote this several weeks ago and sent it to my Senator, Tom Cotton. He never responded. Maybe if you bump into him today, you can ask why.
#TrumpCare Work with Dems and fix ACA.
Like we did when you and Hillary stole nomination from Bernie #PUMA
ABSOLUTELY NO to Trumpcare.  Keep good parts of ACA and fix the rest.  That's what the American people deserve.
But you were ok with the piece of crap called Obamacare.   You have done nothing good for this country!!   Please quit!!
I call daily, and email almost daily.  Don't stop. They need to know that a Yes vote = We vote them out. Keep up the pressure and don't stop
no disrespect sir but it's safe to assume that there about 300 million of us that are opposed to #Trumpcare
Zero redeeming qualities..
Agreed! Repeal & Replace Trump Instead!
TrumpCare is Deathcare American's 
Call your State Senator's 
Thank You!
Everyone call and write your Senators and Congress Reps and tell them to fix Obamacare and Dump Trumpcare. KEep up the messages of NO VOTES
Not trump CARE because he doesn't care
hey tim it still sounds like crickets at your rallies
Hillary & Ukraine collude against trump u remember don't ya Timmy, d.brazil, cnn dnc, dnc sanders, clinton uranium Russia clit foundation
You are crazy...
Doing!!!
From what McConnell sent out earlier they are going to repeal Obamacare first next week.  Don't they need 60 votes for this?
I'm opposed to The the ACA but that didn't stop you losers!
Stop your sabotage of the American people with a repeal.  Fix some of the problems with the ACA
Oh right, our comrades across the isle are still trying to cut taxes for 400 people
It's better than what you got
Dems Dont Want O-Care Gone.. If That Leaves, Then THEY Lose Their Private Healthcare.. You People need to Understand, They Work 4 Themselves
Is calling Senators enough? It's very easy to feel like we're not being heard! Is texting RESIST (for faxing) an effective option?
-----------

No problem Mr. Vice President.
OPPOSED 100%, Tim. Why don't YOU run for president?  You're awesome.
NOT ONLY AM I FOR TRUMP CARE BUT I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY AGAINST ALL YOU WHO VOTE AGAINST IT -OBAMACARE HAS RUINED MY FAMILY'S LIFE
Stop embarrassing yourself with moronic statements like "...this is now a treason investigation." I'm embarrassed for you.
Will you vote yes for Kate's Law? Why won't you state your intentions? I think you're a coward.
I am and have always been opposed to Obamacare!
Have you a alternative like single payer? Didn't think so. Your kickbacks from Insurance moguls would dry up.
Done! Thank you. Keep fighting for us.
I  feel blessed knowing I have a Senator like you
And CONTINUE PUSHING MEDICARE FOR ALL OF COURSE. Very important as adults to be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE.
