BTW- Her record was not positive!
you are the reason we need congressional term limits.
@senalexander & yet can't answer a simple question. DeVos is profoundly unqualified for the job she bought.
She doesn't know her ass from a whole in the ground about public education. Take money from public schools for...
religious education. Government should not fund religion. You failed MI. You live in a world of Trump non-facts.
For God's sake shut up.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Wake up. The people do not want Betsy!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos No, her "qualifications"  to u are siphoning $ from public ed to private & big campaign $ #DumpDevos
Then why do many of the charter schools in Michigan rank near or at the bottom?
That is a great idea!  Let's start by testing the home-schooled kids.
Let DeVos spend her money on charitable work.Don't let her steal our tax dollars away from public schools.
Too bad she is nowhere near qualified.
another person like yourself who has no compassion for the average person
have you lost your mind? If there is a hell you'll be there, no matter how much u pray. Hitler will see u there
A high school janitor is more qualified than devos
At least the janitor has been inside a public school
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos This is laughable.
Lol at the selectively placed "..."'s in this tweet. She doesn't have a record of much, apparently, if it needs the "..." to get there
millions of new eyes focused on you now MM. choose your legacy wisely. currently a disgrace.
Betsy doesn't know anything about being Sec of Educ. Education in US is in bad enough shape w/out her help!
you are both INSANE
Couldn't possibly be less true.
Unless your child happens to have a disability.  Federal Ed Disability law...News to DeVos...
you are wearing blinders
No she doesn't. She did a terrible job in Detroit.
what kind of new speak is this; this appointment turns your swamp a shade darker
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Prove you care about kids. Find someone more qualified than Devos & prove to us you are not corrupt.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! Y'all are funny. Pathetic and arrogant, but funny.
Betsy DeVos is an unqualified hack whose family bought her cabinet position. Just say no to Betsy's confirmation.
Quid. Pro. Quo.
DeVos care nothing about children She knows nothing about running any school .
Record? lining UR pockets w/$ SHAME. Plenty qualified conserv educa leaders&we have most UNQUALIFIED
No she doesn't. Totally unqualified.
Mitch, or whomever is writing this for Mitch, even you know this is not true.
somebody drank too much kool-aid today...or she donate to you as well?
for example?
- please read this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/18/six-astonishing-things-betsy-devos-said-and-refused-to-say-at-her-confirmation-hearing/?tid=sm_fb&utm_term=.12a68d7418e6 …
Sounds like Ms Focus on the Family has the same issues duh governor of KY has; no concept of #SepOfChurchAndState
She opposes providing for children with disabilities.  You are a schmuck.
no qualifications except gives milliions to homophobic, and right wing politics.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Please do not pretend this person has any qualifications to be Sec'y of Education other than $$$$$$
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos More B.S. from the Senate Majority leader.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos I'm a Vandy grad. Concerned that nominee doesn't know ANYTHING about special ed and IDEA.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos no, she's completely unqualified. Disgraceful.
She doesn't. She has no experience/qualifications and her views on special education are disturbing.
GO BETSY.  Be aggressive with the left wing union loving interviewers--DONT TAKE ANY BULLYING ---THE BEST TO YOU!!
did you watch the same hearing I did?
I am sure she does sitting in her ivory tower! You all have your pulse on Main Street, NOT!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos She did horribly at her hearing.  Vote against her
She pushes charter schools. She is not an advocate for quality public education, what the founders wanted.
Keep calling Sen. Alexander and request a 2nd hearing! 423-752-5337 Americans deserve it!
Mailbox full. 9:15 am and no staff answers phones.
Try again in an hour or so. Eventually they have to empty the mailbox. We'll fill it up again!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Woman &her husband have all but destroyed schools in MI. She must not be allowed 2do same nationally
Your Mailbox is full this morning because constituents want a 2nd hearing on Mrs. DeVos so we can learn what else
she doesn't know. We deserve to know what she DOESN'T know!! We have a right, we are talking about our children!
Please, trumps picks have only one thing in mind,same as him.pad my pockets  they have a joint wealth of 5 billion
She's a disaster waiting to happen. She concerns me more than any of Trump's crazy picks. I'm as qualified as her!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos so at what age do you all think we should arm children to protect them from bears?You all are jokes!
If the Dems don't like her, then I do!
@SenAlexander Why do you screw over this country over and over again with your old agenda to get rich and stick it to us
.@SenateMajLdr @SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos What record? Does not knowing about civil rights laws count as compassion?
@SenAlexander of all the educators out there that are qualified..@BetsyDeVos simply isn't one of them.  #dyslexia #education 
That's an out and out lie.
#RepublicansAgainstDeVos never listened 2 MIparents-used$ 2keepCCS.  Do U think parents don't care about children?
This Morning's Thesaurus Update: @SenateMajLdr now synonym for 'delusional'; @BetsyDeVos synonym for 'obscenely unqualified' #political$$$
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Her record is in Michigan only and their success is mixed at best. Disappointing answer about guns
Supporting dt's stooges won't look good soon. But OMG this lady is so unqualified. Please go find "heckuva job" brownie!
Reject her, she's a whack job with ulterior motives to push religion on kids. #FirstAmendment.
2/2 not smart enough to study for her hearing @SenAlexander a disgraceful display of not doing your job
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Even if you don't think she's evil, I don't know why you're pretending she's qualified.  Do your job
on what planet is she remotely qualified- not one - big $$$ buying a position unqualified and not smart enough 1/2
You have to be joking!  She puts $$$ first above all.  She is clueless about education. She is a detriment to education
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos isn't qualified to monitor my school's playground. This job is too important for pay to play!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos so why not all schools enforce IDEA,use same accountability standards & protect children from guns?
UNFIT
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos She is unqualified. Results are poor. Traditional reward for is an Ambassadorship not Sec'y of Ed
She is a child of wealth, educated in private schools and has no context for her policy.  A thousand thousand times no on this one.
Nope.
Obvious to public totally unqualified for this jobl Shameful that she thinks what she's doing is OK
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos did she pay you to say that
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos she is the worst
A sobering look at what Betsy DeVos did to education in Michigan http://wpo.st/HWQS2 
#DeVos
yes, McConnell. YOU would definitely recognize compassion. and @realDonaldTrump knows patriotism.
Instead of providing a study, you give a list of quotes from other right wingers. That is not EVIDENCE. #DumpDevos
liar.
 that's hilarious!!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos You really mean rich white kids, who then get 3 of their friends who then get 3 more ...#richpeople
@SenAlexander  bullshit. Devos is not qualified. She has a personal investment in education being for profit. #1moreround
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos if that is what "preparation" + "experience" looks like, you guys need to go back to class #hotmess
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Resign, If you are not going to faithfully serve all Americans.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos She's a bigot, the last person who needs to be in charge of American education.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Stop manipulating the system for your rich cronies. You work for us, McConnell. DeVos not qualified.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos no she does not have the qualifications or the ability to perform as education secretary
but she hates grizzly bears.
I call bullshit!!!!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos bullshit!
@SenAlexander  So the GOP is willing to destroy us for the sake of theirparty.Fine,you'll be destroyed by our votes in 2 yrs
Doesn't know difference between growth & proficiency, had no clue IDEA was federal program, never been an educator. DEVOS IS NOT QUALIFIED!
She think states should get to make decisions about equal access for kids with disabilities, despite fed law. #BetsyDeVos @watchyourSen
She thinks guns should be allowed in schools. Because grizzlies. #BetsyDeVos @watchyourSen
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos no to patronage jobs. Grossly under qualified. Say no to #DeVos
http://Mitch.You  have said many things, but this proves u really do not care about your country or children
Detroit is all I have to say about that.
I'm a constituent !  NO NO NO NO on Betsy DeValue our education.  She is HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos  DeVos doesn't know the federal laws protecting children with disabilities and doesn't care.
I was not impressed she looked more like a Rich RIno that was bored and needed something to do
More importantly.... She bought the nomination using 200 million dollars.
@SenAlexander Acted like Trump in hearing of Betsty Devos!! A little boy getting back at the other party.# about$bags#shame
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Everyone "cares about kids". Does not qualify you to become Edu Sec. Experience teaching perhaps?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos STOP your embarrassing ur selves and doing a disservice to students.  Get better nominee
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos as a mother I am terrified of the destruction this unqualified nominee will unleash on public ed
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos clearly your sham hearing is evidence of Ms DeVos buying your favor. You are on the payroll sirs
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos the hearings show she is highly unqualified. Where are the ethics disclosures? 1 round of 5 mins?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos how so? By believing IDEA doesn't have to be followed? You're robbing students out of a future!
great there are many church youth groups out there. She's still not qualified to run Ed.
Bullshit
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Are you paying any attention? She's completely unqualified! You should be ashamed of yourselves!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Were we watching the same hearing?? She's totally incompetent! No business as Sec of Ed
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos can you cite concrete examples of proven record?
Proven how? Please show proof.Michigans scores are down in Detroit where her for profit charters have wreaked havoc.
Skills, experience, ethical conduct are at least as important as passion. My children deserved a better interview!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos showed absolutely no understanding of need for protection of kids with disabilities under IDEA
Unless you're a child with a disability, right Senator. Then screw you, we don't care. #PartyOverCountry
Lies lies and more lies. How many years did she teach in public schools? O Children deserve better than her.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos You're as ignorant as she clearly is on education. #PartyOverCountry
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Betsy our tax $$ not 4 zealot purpose Use YOUR $$ 4 religious insanity We need schools 4 ALL kids!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Absolute Bullshit of the highest order. Absurd corruption. All she has is a huge checkbook.
She doesn't understand the basic premise of #IDEA ! How can she head the dept. of ed. w/out basic knowledge?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos hearing was disappointing. As most have been. These are kids that deserve better! Guns,bears really!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos You are all completely disgusting trying to profit off of our children's UNeducation!!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos you are insane
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos She isn't qualified for this job. If you push this through you will show your disdain for children.
Thank you .@SenAlexander for dealing politely but firmly with the alt-Left crazoid @SenWarren today! @BetsyDeVos
endorsing someone that today clearly proved she's not qualified says more about your credibility than hers #BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos you can't mess with children's futures! Many people watched regardless of party. She is Un qualified
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos we seen enough in round 1. you can't justify her incompetence! American people were watching
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos NOOOOOOO!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos not qualified to be Sec of Ed! Insulting to educators and parents that she was even nominated.
@SenateDems @GOP #Trump #MAGA 

Humorous to watch @SenWarren flip

http://conservativeread.com/elizabeth-warren-was-school-voucher-supporter-before-trump-was-elected/ …
How can someone lead the education department who knows nothing about IDEA?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Were you watching the same hearing?!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos SHE'S A TOTAL DISASTER!! Wake up! The majority of this country IS NOT WITH YOU ON THIS & is OUTRAGED
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos I am appalled that you would confirm such a nominee with no experience or clue about education! No!
@SenAlexander This is not a partisan issue. She is not qualified for this position. No knowledge of IDEA Proficiency & Growth
whyre u having a hearing if ethics paperwk not done Hiding somethg? Why limit ?? #badoptics, #GOP.
Her record of the programs she has advocated for does not have a broad base of success.  Extend her hearing!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos ACTUALLY she doesn't have a proven record of anything when it comes to education.
DeVos will not protect disabled children, enforce federal law on sexual assault, and is a debt collector on student loans. No no no DeVos
The GOP shows that "real compassion" as it guts the ACA, which you have lied about since day 1. DeVos another lie
NOT QUALIFIED
can't even answer the lost simple of questions
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos did you watch the same confirmation hearing the rest of America did???? 

Sen. Al Franken discovers Trump Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth. 
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander Welcome 2 trickle down educ. Only the wealthy get educ & the rest of us have 2 hope we get a share #DeVosHearing
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos according to her testimony, not the disabled ones. You sick, horrible people.
She has no credentials!  How can she lead teachers when she doesn't have a teaching degree?
@SenAlexander As a Republican, I am not impressed w/ her.  Speak w/ parents & teachers about her.  We know what IDEA is!!
No she does not! Remove partisanship and politics from the equation! Start listening to WE THE PEOPLE!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Dumbing down America won't get you anymore voters. Send her to run Russian Education system.
@SenAlexander she has a record for destroying schools, just ask the publicly schools in MI
It seems like she's a crackpot who wants to dismantle our school system.  Do you want to dumb down America?
Under Fuhrer please tell the truth. You & Fuhrer lie!!!
@SenAlexander she is a donor/lobbyist, fellas. But, you know that.
LIAR   You should be so ashamed of yourself!!
This statement doesn't even make logical sense, it's a educational-sounding word salad @DianaMiller5
We expected better from you esp. education. Allow full vetting of ALL candidates!  @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos STOP she has no qualifications with preparing students in STEM or mgmt of huge budgets. STUDENTS 1st
@SenAlexander What is this? Your promoting @BetsyDeVos? Now cronyism is in education? Unacceptable. She is unqualified.
explain this "proven record" since she certainly didn't do that in her hearing.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos she doesn't have any experience being a teacher.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos quit your lying Mitch! She will work to privatize schools solely for the benefit of you and your ilk
Compassion isn't a substitute for experience/qualification. Shame on you for playing politics w education of our country's next generation
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos why do you hate Americans so much?
are you kidding yourself? Even you cannot be that stupid..oh right...you can be..
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos god help our children if you confirm her.  You are a disposable, self-serving lot.
meant to say despicable.  If only you were disposable.
