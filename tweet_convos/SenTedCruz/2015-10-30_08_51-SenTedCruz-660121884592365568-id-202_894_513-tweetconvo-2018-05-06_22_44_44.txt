@SenTedCruz I guess the 18 RINOs who voted for this perversion of founding intent don't realize they've put a giant target on their backs.
@SenTedCruz Thank you for fighting the #WashingtonCartel - unlike the establishment freaks, you actually STAND up for us! #CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz Total betrayal of those who voted for this budget

@zoccolopolis @SenTedCruz They won't do that. They are afraid to stand on their own. They use the GOP, otherwise they have no power at all.
@SenTedCruz I know this is the senate and not the house but shouldn't the "Hastert rule" apply here for McConnell to bring this to the floor
@SenTedCruz saw the list of those voting with D, but am curious if Rubio showed up to vote on this one, b/c IT'S A BIG DEAL!!!
