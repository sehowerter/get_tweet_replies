@SenTedCruz how can the American people trust you to be president when you refuse to do your current job, Senator?
@AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz He has been doing an awesome job as Senator!
@cindysharmony @AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz FACT: he hasn't.
Unless you count filibustering against healthcare for 21 hours a good job.
@LongestNameOnTw @AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz Obamacare funds death panels, raises insurance rates & funds the murder of children. No thanks
@LongestNameOnTw @AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz People have been trying to shut up common sense for decades. Your tactics prove you have none.
@cindysharmony @AdamDannyDaniel do u realize how f-ed up this is? A man & a woman having an argument abt women's health, & woman is agst it!
@LongestNameOnTw @AdamDannyDaniel How do see the destruction of a women's body & the murder of her unborn daughter or son as women's health?
@SenTedCruz Thanks for the third grade civics lesson.
@SFPhotoguy @SenTedCruz Children nowadays do not have a class in which they learn the Constitution.  He is kind enough to inform all people.
@cindysharmony @SFPhotoguy @SenTedCruz it's called US History, unfortunately textbooks are filled with nonsense.
@AdamDannyDaniel @SFPhotoguy @SenTedCruz There is one book that can be trusted to be an accurate text. The Bible.
@cindysharmony @AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz You've got to be kidding. The bible was made like laws and sausage.
@SFPhotoguy @AdamDannyDaniel @SenTedCruz Not kidding simply fact everything The Bible says has and will come true..
@cindysharmony @SFPhotoguy @SenTedCruz ok, so harmony is just your name, not something you actually practice.
@AdamDannyDaniel @SFPhotoguy @SenTedCruz Harmony & compromise r not =.  Christians being forced 2 compromise beliefs 4 "harmony" =surrender.
@SenTedCruz amen ted "if the situation need be" you will stand tall, and defend the constitution, and block all obama's lib prog nominees
So you'd "defend the Constitution" by blocking the President from doing what the Constitution instructs him to do? @bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz
Senate's job is to "advise and consent". Proclaiming they won't let a specific POTUS nominate anyone isn't "advice". @castledarkmoor
Well your party reflexively rejected Brian Sandoval, who's on the same part of the political spectrum as Anthony Kennedy. @castledarkmoor
@SenTedCruz  Yes. The constitution is clear must be a natural born citizen to be #POTUS  @GOP is betraying USA
@SenTedCruz Question - if elected do you promise not to appoint a judge in your last year? There is no valid reason to refuse to do your job
@SenTedCruz So do your job and consider the nomination that has been presented!  Or resign
@SenTedCruz DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!
@SenTedCruz SHALL. 1/3 of presidents nominated in an election year. We'll work hard to see it's never you.
@SenTedCruz http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=9547 …
@SenTedCruz @HomunculusLoikm yes, and so likly is the grandfather clause in the US Constitution Artical II, Section 1, Clause 5.
@SenTedCruz Senators don't like you. You won't be able to get anything done as POTUS.
@SenTedCruz Why don't you just say, Neener Neener Neener you can't make me?     @realDonaldTrump would do it.
#DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz @littlebytesnews Yes and poor poor Obama is very pissed off about them holding off till new POTUS.
@SenTedCruz  does that mean u will show up 2 vote this time? We missed u on mon. when @JohnKingJr. was voted in do we still have 2 pay u?
@SenTedCruz And what will be the excuse when a Democrat is elected as the next president?
@AVNSher @SenTedCruz Stupid voters that think Trump isn't a Democrat, too.  #Drumpf
@MellowCat22 ???
@SenTedCruz  Ted, PA Teacher/Agribusiness owner, grandma, Dad Purple Heart Vet. Cant chuz u, TOO SMUG, don't listen, ruthless, deceitful, NO
@SenTedCruz If elected as POTUS, which I doubt, you will see how it feels to be abused as you guys did to your leader President Obama!
@SenTedCruz can you explain why the nominee isn't qualified? #LyinTed #doyourjob
@SenTedCruz Who if they were following the Constitution, which I believe is the law of the country,would discuss like they're suppose to.
@SenTedCruz The constitution is also clear that Canadian Cruz is ineligible for President of USA. Not a natural born citizen!!!
@SenTedCruz  Absolutely, behind you all the way. My Texas Senator!
@SenTedCruz obviously not clear enough it says potus WILL not may, and the Senate WILL vote
@SenTedCruz     I believe this guy is a phony. Ted Cruz you're worst than Donald Trump. He shows us who he is. You're a hypocrite!
@SenTedCruz just a biggot liar
@SenTedCruz WE NO THAT BUT HIS NOMINEE DESERVES A VOTE.
@SenTedCruz @rxpatriot46 You guys love changing the rules to fit your agenda.Fist Obama now your own Frontrunner.
@SenTedCruz @bwtanker And if Trump is nominee, gets shellacked, loses senate, Obama can nominate & new senate approve choice. #NeverTrump
@SenTedCruz #ProfessorTedCrude -Thank you for making it crystal clear the Republicans will obstruct obstruct obstruct - my vote is for Trump
@SenTedCruz Article 2 Section 2  Clause 2
@SenTedCruz Your argument would hold water if congress would even bother to make a counter-proposal. They just refuse to deal with Obama.
@SenTedCruz GOP doing what they do best, nada. GOP could put forth its own slate (if GOP could agree)-better than the usual shutdown
@SenTedCruz Picturing you shouting this through a miniature kazoo, wearing a diaper on the lap of the Lincoln Monument; Jesus weeps.
@SenTedCruz Cruz is Wrong AGAIN, the Pres Nominates The Judge, the Senate ONLY Confirms/Denies, Cruz needs 2 read Constitution
@SenTedCruz You are still obligated to have hearings n nominations.
@SenTedCruz the best position for YOU...is in that open court position.
@SenTedCruz Then tell Mitch McConnell to get off his lazy ass
@SenTedCruz I know about 'advise and consent.' Where in the Constitution does it say you can withhold nominations just because...?#DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz grant and consent might just be the same, Rafael.
@SenTedCruz wrong, Rafael. It's advise and consent. So when are you going to advise?
@SenTedCruz "Shall" nominate. It's mandatory. And "advise and consent" applies only to the merits of a particular nominee.
@SenTedCruz @coff33loveit Geico commercial: Everybody knows that!
@SenTedCruz #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz Senator Cruz, tune out the noise & stay the course! There are patriots behind you who see the truth!  Praying for you
@SenTedCruz it clearly states "And the Senate shall appoint" U die hard love the constitution but only when it benefits you and your agenda
@SenTedCruz what if YOU were nominated by #POTUS @BarackObama?
@SenTedCruz oh you all these years just want to get rid of everything
@SenTedCruz you should b next judge u would b so good! Can you and trump be together I like u both! You would be perfect team!
@SenTedCruz @SenTedCruz The US Senate should stop stalling and conduct The People's business with due diligence. Elections have no baring.
@SenTedCruz Advice & Consent. You can always advise not to nominate.
@SenTedCruz Its Obama all over again.
@SenTedCruz shouldn't you be more concerned with what date you're gonna drop out Teddy?
@SenTedCruz #Canada has so much to offer! could we trade you for @JustinTrudeau?
@SenTedCruz @drginareghetti "Advise and consent" includes advising President that Senate will not consent to any of his #SCOTUS nominees.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz just do your damn job and stop obstructing progress Raphael. #VetsAgainstCruz
@SenTedCruz Then can we get some help with the LYING MSM pushing Dem narrative, 'GOP are obstructionists NOT following Constitution'?
@SenTedCruz And no member of Congress up for re-election should be allowed to vote during election year! (Thx @psalm82 4 that!)
@SenTedCruz good night sir
@SenTedCruz yes but as @JoeBiden pointed out a REAL statesman would not do so in his last year in office
@SenTedCruz @kksheld y would the Senate believe  the President who has trampled  the Constitution bby threatening yhem in2 a vote 4 SCOTUS
@SenTedCruz Trump admits in debate he buys politicians, "a number of times". He isnt the solution to corruption, he IS the corruption.
@SenTedCruz Not "may"--> SHALL
@SenTedCruz looking forward to the 17 days in January when a Democratic controlled senate rams a VERY liberal justice down your throat.
@SenTedCruz The President is supposed to pick a nominee that does"t mean that person  has to  confirmed
@SenTedCruz So the senate needs to do its job which they were elected to do!
@SenTedCruz Go back to Canada and the Constitutions says nothing about the Senate having the power to grant, or withhold consent.
Hey @SenTedCruz quest who won Donald Trump and you came in third again lol
@SenTedCruz Constitution also says to do your job. Karma will slap you down..Trump will win & it's all your fault!
@SenTedCruz #DoYourJob and listen to a nomination then. I know you're preoccupied with applying for another job now, but at the moment focus
@SenTedCruz  @CNN says theme to record voter turnout is "anger at federal govt." so can't you see obstructing #SCOTUS is part of problem?
@SenTedCruz no duh. But it also says congress is supposed to declare war but when was the last time you did your job?
@SenTedCruz The word "withhold" does not appear in the Constitution. And surely "advice and consent" involves finding out the will by vote
@SenTedCruz if you are natural born, why were you naturalized in order to become an American citizen? Birthright citizenship v natural born
@SenTedCruz Don't worry. Trump has it under control.
@SenTedCruz @DeborahLovesUSA      IF THESE SPINELESS TWO FACED COWARDS GIVE IN THEY ARE THROUGH!
@SenTedCruz @RTHTGakaRoland 

Please pass that onto Mr.Stompy-foot.
#LawlessObama
@Smittyshs 'Mr.Stompy-foot' <= Good. Obama is much too like (worse) some of my friends tweenage daughters in tone and dramatics.
@SenTedCruz
@RTHTGakaRoland @SenTedCruz 

He's behaved as though a petulant, whiny, little girl throughout his entire presidency.
#Legacy
@SenTedCruz Not for this reason.
@SenTedCruz Withholding, or not doing your job, isn't the intent of the constitution. If you hold the constitution high, vote or, lazyfuck
@SenTedCruz drop out you can't win and haven't broke 3rd in last 3 races only lying and helping Trump!
@SenTedCruz your hypocrisy is why your loosing to a reality tv star! And your bible pushing tossing people out message is failing preacher
@SenTedCruz I studied the constitution heavily at UCLA. What you r saying is treason. This is stripping the judicial branch of its power.
@SenTedCruz You're are not an American. How dare you not support the your commander and chief! #
@SenTedCruz Thanks for giving your careful consideration for not just blindly vowing to block any nominees No wonder people hate Washington
@SenTedCruz @kksheld Well said!
@SenTedCruz @sheila14all little gay barry got shut down. Nonstarter. Love it. Same with b.s. gitmo move.
@SenTedCruz All the more reason to vote your sorry asses out of office!
@SenTedCruz @RobForshey Dems wrote the book on delaying appointments. Yet tables have turned and now they're criticizing it. #gofigure
@SenTedCruz That being the case, there's nothing 2 prevent Dems from doing the same thing on Day 1 if they win Senate and lose the WH.
@SenTedCruz To refuse to even CONSIDER a nominee is childish petulance & obstruction. Our twice-elected @POTUS WILL do HIS job. DO YOURS.
@GammaRae206 he's such a liar claims to just love the constitution only when it pertains to his wants #LyingTed
@SenTedCruz Do.Your.Job #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz It says "shall," not "may."
@SenTedCruz How long until you are deported back to Canada?
@SenTedCruz, SoTypical ofObama 2push his BAD DEEDS while everyone isDistracted.
@SenTedCruz when do the interests of Americans come into play? Do politicians ever stop pandering to their base and do the right thing?
@SenTedCruz Just because you have the right to be a jackass that doesn’t mean you should. #DoYourJob #FullCourt2016
@SenTedCruz seems like your read a few longs in there
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex Excuse me sir, but who do you think you are some kind of lawyer who has studied the Constitution for decades?
@SenTedCruz But not power to refuse due consideration of the nominees because you hate the President - & you want to be POTUS? Sheesh, bud.
@SenTedCruz Constitution is clear, hold hearings. No SCOTUS would ever be replaced under your absurd theory. Do your job, free to vote no.
@SenTedCruz Admit it: you cowards just don't have the balls to hold a vote.
@SenTedCruz Is that what "with the advice and consent of the Senate" means? Over reaching aren't we.
@SenTedCruz and the senate responsibility is not to side with your political aspirations by friend.
@SenTedCruz YES LETS FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION FOR A CHANGE
@SenTedCruz @SweetFreedom29
@SenTedCruz @Barackoboehner That is exactly why we need you in the #Senate not running for POTUS. @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz great ad with pledge etc where thehell has that been? U got bad advice from some great ad
@SenTedCruz cunt.
@SenTedCruz @catsim7 poindexter can nominate the rest of the year so lock the doors.
@SenTedCruz stand firm!
@SenTedCruz Get a proxy group back to D.C. then, before POTUS pulls a fast one
@SenTedCruz @instapundit Even Mitch McConnell figured this one out, but thanks for playing.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz 
Is Ted Cruz against or for crop insurance subsidies?
@SenTedCruz You would voluntarily allow SCOTUS to be incomplete? This is why you will never be elected president. Bad form.
@SenTedCruz @deaninwaukesha Shall nominate, not may nominate.
@illusory_tenant You literalist. ;^) @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Hey Rafael!!  You might need a SCOTUS decision to continue; they can't decide with 8, like they do in Canada apparently.
@SenTedCruz Please stay strong on this. Do not give them the court
@SenTedCruz INSERT FOOT INTO MOUTH CAUSE NEITHER CRUZ OR RUBIO ARE Doing THERE JOB AS SENATORS
@SenTedCruz I STRONGLY BELIEVE CRUZ SHOULD BE THE Next SCOTUS. You have TO MUCH SHADY CAMPAIGN LIES FOR POTUS. Hoping ON THE TRUMP POTUS
@SenTedCruz What w/ all the dirty tricks, I'm surprised you have enough time to ruin the judiciary branch.
@ZenPopArt @SenTedCruz    You are so right! Love it. Lol
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump Well, since this is his last year, why doesn't he nominate his brother Al Sharpton.
@SenTedCruz  what a bunch of crap posted.  Haters are going to hate.  Keep up the good fight for freedon
@SenTedCruz Obstructionism does not equal representation. #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz Obama thinks the constitution is a negative document,any recess taken will give him an opportunity to appoint our worse fears
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump What difference does it make when illegals get free soccer balls & teddy bears while Veterans are still dying?
@SenTedCruz  REPUBLICAN B S .
@SenTedCruz part of mandate is advise. Not having hearing/vote violates your oath to uphold constitution, making u ineligible for presidency
@SenTedCruz As a self described constitutional lawyer, how do you always get it so wrong?  The constitution says "shall", not may.
@SenTedCruz I hope you enjoy finishing last in primaries
@SenTedCruz Not MAY Teddy-boy SHALL.
@SenTedCruz how does not holding a hearing or a vote abide by that standard?
@SenTedCruz consent would be a yes or no vote, but you want to play politics and not even do your constitutional duty. #shameonyou
@SenTedCruz Teddy don't ever show to vote you crooked Cruz
@SenTedCruz you're done. Bye Ms. Thing!
@SenTedCruz Hold the line @Senate_GOPs
@SenTedCruz   DO YOUR JOB or LOSE IT
@SenTedCruz #Zodiac #killer #YouTrollYouMonster
@SenTedCruz what'd ya do go read it ....finally. Derp
@SenTedCruz Actually, the constitution says the President "shall" nominate Judges of the Supreme Court.
@SenTedCruz bunch of statists spewing their bile here..stand strong Td!
@SenTedCruz Advise and consent.  That means at least a hearing followed by an up or down vote.  DO YOUR JOB
@SenTedCruz and people wonder why this #Congress is the most ineffective in history
@SenTedCruz ha, haters following you @SenTedCruz keep doing your thing sooner or later the truth will set you free
@SenTedCruz on Gitmo and nominations, can congress not control this rogue president or do we elect a different congress?
@SenTedCruz Also, Senate must prevent #Obama from using exec order 2 appoint justice 2 #SCOTUS, if he does we effectively hv Americn dictatr
.@SenTedCruz You're a funny one to be citing Constitutional clarity.
@SenTedCruz I thought it said POTUS shall nominate......
@SenTedCruz Yes, but ppl arent listening, #progressive college profs BRAINWASHING young ppl, they dont know TRUE #Constitution!
@SenTedCruz I agree. No more justices. Let the current ones die off.
@SenTedCruz Refusing to hear from ant nominee is cowardice.
@SenTedCruz EXACTLY, after a hearing. Can't withhold consent w/o a vote. You're a dolt. Don't withhold the vote.
@SenTedCruz Stand Strong against Senate
@SenTedCruz talk about activist interpretation. Rewriting const.-effectively moving power to appt. Justices to Congress. Not how I read it.
@SenTedCruz But never in history has one party refused to give even a hearing (or a meeting) with the sitting President's SCOTUS nominee
@SenTedCruz   The Constitution says we deserve 9 justices now. Obstruction is NOT LEADERSHIP!!!
@SenTedCruz what? Retournez a ton pays!
@SenTedCruz @Tab1791 and once again, the Republican party puts itself before the country, which is why you will lose the upcoming election!
@SenTedCruz finally
@SenTedCruz the president SHALL nominate judges of the Supreme Court by and with advice and consent of senate.  DON'T LIE!
@SenTedCruz Say it louder, they can't hear in the White House!
@SenTedCruz
