@SenTedCruz
America is too #WethePeople R not blind 2 the #WaCartel #DCcorruption & Now We WILL #CleanHouse #TicToc #TrumpTrain #SteamRollin
Actually, we just need to remove you you first class POS !
Radical Religious Terrorism is what it is and it comes in all flavors, simplistic bigotry doesn't help resolve anything.
@radioguru157 no it's just ISLAM read the damn book.
WRONG, he wasn't even Muslim you RW whack jobs jump the gun again http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nice-truck-attack-suspect-identified-police-source-tells-afp_uk_57889cd9e4b0f4bc5946eac5 …
@STEPHMHAMILL Hello###??? Ted Cruz is not ready yet ? (1) you need to be sports, Strong, & fighter back to talk that's a kind@my
@STEPHMHAMILL @Sen Ted   Cruz ,your not to be a president the next generation . all we need you help to our cntry btter @God FGY
Sharia law needs to be banned in #America
@daylightdis credit where credit is due :-)
it not radical its Islam. Wake up Cruz @LuvGodFamUSA
So back off attacking innocents in the Middle East
@eloracnasus 

Ok, and what good will that do?
"Radical Islamic terrorism". 
There.
Problem solved.
All is well.
@STEPHMHAMILL Radical Islamic has declared open war with West and WH just yawns
& the @GOP and @TPPatriots in congress continue to do nothing & leave it up to the @POTUS they hate!
@Stordoor @tvogvo @SenTedCruz
To ensure they will think twice next time, the terrorist ENTIRE FAMILIES must be PUT IN JAIL- including the children!!!
.... #FU
@Rparisee lying Ted he voted for Moslem refugee resettlement in U.S.
@mgd4177  senator, stay in the shadow
@GOP impeach Obama for covering it up.he erased all words that pertained to Islamic radicals. HLS and DOJ did too.
It is constitutional McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 allows us to block Islamic terrorist from coming in.
and Obama has let in thousands of un vetted Muslims. and redacted doc that would have alerted us to Islamic teror.
No Ted, it's called "Religious Extremism"....
@STEPHMHAMILL @May.. I watch You? last night? so many people upset because ! you so selfish the next time you joined u lost @M??
Ted, though I am a Trump guy..U can really help America bye sticking to your game for all of us...Someday, it'll be you up there
Jumped the Gun, Senator; as U so often do. Truck driver in NICE, was a local; who was recently cited for Road Rage; LOCO 
SICKO!
declare war on radical Islamic terrorism. #legacy only pres. not willing to protect his country.
Well I don't think carpet bombing and killing innocent civilians is a good answer!
@j1m1v  and you voted to let terror suspects legally buy guns
@Hardline_Stance France has for quite awhile recognized this and has spoken of it. BHO turns away to focus on climate change.
@charlesbigfoot Sure! And fake language used by the press over the world!
Ted... Finally making sense bro.
when is the @POTUS going to blame law-abiding US gun owners for what happens in #NiceAttack?
@MJNRealtor that's still blinders. Their own teachings literally condone this sort of thing. Take no time at all to see that.
except... it's not "radical" is it? @neonobjclash
@DaveDoom2008.  The first Islamic sympathizer we need to get rid of lives in the WH.
CRUZ HAS TO GO!
I AGREE
@indieguy888 YOU need to take your blinders OFF and admit you LOST the nomination! #StupidGlobalist #LyingTed
Yes! Because calling it a different name will totally stop it. By that logic, let me call you Rafael.
The facts aren't out yet darling, and even if it is Isis...it's not Islam issuing the attack. It's fanatics (you know, like you)
it's nice for you to say those words.  I think you've solved the problem for good.  Whew!  #ANYBODYBUTTEDCRUZ
In France they use your favorite terminology and continue to be attacked.
we as a nation have put up with 8 yrs of Muslim sympathy.Im just not on board with thT attitude.Take heads out of sand
What terrorism?  Just another case of not enough gun control laws.  Right?
I'm standing beside you!
so your plan is to what, bomb France?
I agree maybe we should try to overturn #Obamacare again or have 150 FBI agents focused on an email server to stop it !
looool, only problem is that the driver was a 31 year old French dude. Sorry
@JeffLee2020 Yeah, funded by you and buddies. Even Generals in ur Armed Forces agree. When's last time you took them out?
You and your children should go fight them. 
When are you leaving?
@scout_nj we know what it is . did you convince Obama while you were pals with him on his plane? I supported u now I get hate
We need the truth!!!!!
. Do you have any idea how despised you will be four years from now?
@NoQuarter_Given THIS is world war 3
Why not just islam Ted?  Have you read the koran?  Apparently not.
@Darren32895836
Go back to your hole. You've stirred up quite enough problems. You're a divider & we have enough of them right now. 
@jmartNYT It is about Time Cruz.
@realkingrobbo can you send a memo to WA explaining what that means? They don't seem to understand. Can't say ISIS either.
It's time we went on the offense in this matter.
the truck made him do it 
NASA n Pentagon can see any corner of the World, but cannot destroy ISIS??????????????
what is the solution more weapons more troops more deaths more injured vets that we do not take care of be realistic
we have known what it is what do you not understand terrorist see us as something that needs to be gone our way of life or gov
It's a fucking braindead religious idiot with a truck. Let's call it what it is.
Your right Ted. Keep the pressure on the Libs. They are cowards.
@SenTedCruz
how would Jesus say to handle it?
semantics and labels won't defeat this threat .. It's a collective global effort including Muslims to counter this menace.#Idiot
Hey Ted, time to keep your word and support Trump!
thank you!  YOU had my family's vote!
Compared to what? Submit to your radicalized Christian ideology. No thanks. Both evil.
as if no one knows this
You are so right, Senator Cruz! Thank you 4speaking truth!
What would Prez Cruz do? Who would he attack/bomb to stop random ISIS/ISIL inspired individuals in multiple countries?
And you will stop it by...?? Wow, if only u were a senator...
yes it is and we have to get focused on the real threat that they are going to capitalize on our issues that are going on now.
#blacklivesmatter, this is true, however right now we have to all take care of all Americans.
Black,white,Asian, and all other races that call America home.
Hey good luck with your wolf in sheep's clothing have a great time and may God please bless the USA
everyone in congress must read this book.
; We are at war.
you're starting to repeat yourself like Robot Rubio, try a reboot.
we have to recognize this for what it is, a mindless parrot repeating the same magical incantation over & over, never actions.
Weird, you said the magic words and yet......nothing is different.
Then what, sir. Cross your arms and blink your eyes?
.@SenTedCruz @marklevinshow It is too late for the US, they are here. They are already here.
fundamental Islam
Oh, well, I feel safer now. Thanks for that.
E N D O R S E
so what's new ? When is someone other than Orilley going to call POTUS an Islamic sympathizer?
the trojan horse is obama
Ted,if you and that do nothing Republican Congress,would work for all of us and not a few,we could really wipe out terrorists!
FUNDAMENTAL IDIOTS!
Yes, we MUST accept it is coming, no it is here.  We must do more than just pray, be aware and inform authorities.
your exploitation of the ignorant is disgusting.  @tomservo10 BTW, this is a siege.
and once you remove the blinders then what?
is Barack Hussein Obama going to take the trucks out of the terrorists hands so they can't kill civilians
A@rn
.@SenTedCruz 

Good Lord!  I simply had not considered that possibility till now.
Not radical! Just Islam 101!
IMPEACH OBAMA...Doesn't have our BEST interest at heart @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @USArmy
why do u feel it necessary to post what we all know.quit treating us like morons
@jmartNYT Good point, Radical Clown Terrorism would be far less scary. The cultural ID of the terrorist makes all the difference
As opposed to radical Christian terrorism that people like YOU support one hundred percent.
Don't say it so loudly you may hurt someone's feelings.
It is Islam. Period. Calling it radical would assume there is really a peaceful side. Pls do something. TX is the next France.
Talk is cheap! Man up, support and volunteer 2 be a strong Cabinet member w/ Trump.  U r so smart, show common sense, please..
True Story
WAKE UP AMERICA
Ted you need to put on your thinking cap.......
#texasasshole.
@jmartNYT Strange. You have the same goal as ISIS with your rhetoric: provoking a religious war
@Stordoor No choice but to sift through Western Muslims to identify & deport the irreconcilables & let the rest prove themselves
@jmartNYT Finally, the magic words!  Victory is at hand!
still can't believe u rode with Obama and Pelosi...... Don't know how to feel about that.
He still thinks no one knows who we are fighting and that calling it by a specific name will change things. Yet another GOP fool
don't quote tweet yourself
@jmartNYT Or #ReichstagFire? Global extreme #OpChaos spawns disorder-believes "from chaos-order"-pave way for fascism #FalseFlag
@jmartNYT ok.. Then what?
great, sending you into Syria asap @SenTedCruz
I like that!
Send Ted Cruz and Little Rubio to Syria or Cuba!
keep saying it click your heels:  problem solved
@jmartNYT Or #ReichstagFire? Global extr #OpChaos spawns disorder-believes "from chaos-order"-pave way for fascism #FalseFlag
keep the worthless statements coming
. Yes, and they are hell bent on jihad and the destruction of western civilization. Our PC will be our downfall. It's WAR!!
ENDORSE TRUMP NOW!
 Watch your SIX at all times.
TED PLEASE B NICE @ / CONVENTION. IF U R NOT U WILL PROVE 2 EVERY ONE THAT U R AS BAD AS THEY SAY U R. COMPLIMENTS 2 U 4 GOING.
We bombed the JAPS, lets Bomb the ISIS bastard and drive around in Arabian cars. LOL
Ted make no mistake, AmericaUSA is also under siege.  Wake up.
on HRC's watch...  ISIS formed its Caliphate.  The "Mother" of ISIS.
we are being terrorized by @reince and our own party! We are distraught and depressed!
It's time for #America "under the leadership of @realDonaldTrump" to rescue Europe again. Wipe the middle east off the Earth.
We NEED REAL AMERICAN LEADERS NOW!

#FightForWesternCivilization

@SenTedCruz
Because you have all the facts. Why aren't you on a plane handing over the evidence?
senator Cruz endorse Donald J Trump. I know it was white knuckle combat but liberalism has to be stopped.
anyone that is not Muslim, religion of hate, is under siege
absolutely.that is why we must unite and not devide.The trump train is coming to run over the Clinton dynasty
Yep, we've had it up to here with radical religion in all its forms.
neuroscience, Dark Tetrad, and psychopathy research says differently. @FBI @CIA @SecretService
tonight after scam rules committee  meeting I am going to leave the republican party..
This needs to be part of your speech next week. Obama is a disaster. Hillary will be as bad or worse.
"We"?  Don't you mean Congress has to do something about Obama?
#Cruz2020 #RunTedRun #VoteCruz
Europe is in a War and so it the USA. Time to take gloves off. Time for a real President.
Why did the gop's in Congress refuse to vote on declaring war to give the prez war powers?
when was that vote? I didn't hear about it
http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-war-against-isis-will-go-undeclared/390618/ …

So they could bitch & not be responsible!
Why are you not our candidate. We need you Senator Cruz
Stop using leftist language. Even you can't admit that it's not "radical". It's "devout".
yes sir u r very right
if you want to REALLY help make a difference..support Trump.
But what next?
