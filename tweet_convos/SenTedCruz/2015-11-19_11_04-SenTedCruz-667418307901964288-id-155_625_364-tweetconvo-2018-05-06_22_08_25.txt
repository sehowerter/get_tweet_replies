@SenTedCruz Ted, you've been waging JIHAD against America for years, can we revoke your citizenship (that you don't really have)?
@Libertyforusal LOL What an intelligent tweet! Look at all those words you strung together! Take your head out of your ass pal. GTFOH
@PirateWench oh I'm sorry my tweet was above your head. Let me simplify it for you. You. Understand that part? Are       An   Idiot . clear?
@SenTedCruz amazed @PirateWench forgets Clinton impeachment. #LiberalLogic
@tonytwobets @SenTedCruz for lying to congress. Not for doing his job. Must be a crime. Not just a butt hurt.
@PirateWench oh wait, sounds like a daily occurrence with Obama. Just hating on conservatives.  Should get new SN @bitterbetty
@tonytwobets @PirateWench @bitterbetty No Cruz has the mkt on hate.  Russia & France a little late to Obama's party
@dewattobay Good gods Maria! Don't confuse their little grey cells with actual FACTS!!!  @tonytwobets @bitterbetty
@SenTedCruz
@jammaj1181 unpatriotic folks like are needed in Syria btw who's been ordering all of this? 7K sorties to date
@dewattobay not sure if that's ur failed policies or ur BS views!?!
@SenTedCruz And they all deserve to be removed from office for willfully endangering US citizens.
@Avenged110 @SenTedCruz this senator with his rhetoric has certainly guaranteed more jihadists
@SenTedCruz @Sassafras_Knob you want all republicans to have their citizenship taken away?
Marc please at least get your facts correct for once just once is all we ask Ty @ba55bar @SenTedCruz
@Sassafras_Knob @ba55bar try these FACTS! Obama has ordered bombs ISIS TWO+ yrs. Russia & France late to the party
@dewattobay @Sassafras_Knob @ba55bar What was he bombing? Camel patties?
@SenTedCruz I
That's ok hang on to it when Trump and you get into office the you will get it passed. We have to take our country  back.
@dana_hinkley hopefully someone takes it back from NON THINKERS
@SenTedCruz @lsferguson Dems are terrorists, 100%.
@SenTedCruz can we also do it for all Americans who shoot random victims for no reason?
@SenTedCruz how could anyone object to that? It's practically asking for a terror attack
@SenTedCruz @jimbearNJ You omit to mention you'd bar entry to refugees from terrorist-controlled http://countries.care  to elaborate?
@Jomc20 @SenTedCruz  The top 5 wealthiest Muslim countries have taken in NO refugees They did it in September for national security concerns
@jimbearNJ @SenTedCruz 3 million are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. It is disgraceful that wealthiest Muslim countries haven't helped.
@SenTedCruz @aronianb 

Should Be  A Given!
@SenTedCruz if this gets approved, you and the GOP congressmen can kiss your ass bye-bye then based on your actions!
@SenTedCruz Senate Dems object to smug jackasses preening before the cameras. Your GOP colleagues do, too. #GoAway
@SenTedCruz what about Christian terrorists????
@SenTedCruz democratic party can go to hell with isis. the thing they have left out too is how much the refugees will cost the American ppl
@SenTedCruz Wow. They object because it makes too much sense, per usual.
@slinger6 Cruz is a coward - doesn't have a plan for the REAL enemies
@SenTedCruz Careful...you may loose your citizenship
@SenTedCruz @lsferguson Yeah, they need the votes.  They are selling our country out.
@SenTedCruz @58163 on what possible grounds? Never mind- don't answer that-- just insanity
@SenTedCruz @conens46 RECALL THEM ALL, TRY, CONVICT AND IMPRISON FOR TREASON.
@SenTedCruz @conens46 that's just common sense
@SenTedCruz and who decides?Lying weasels like you?
@SenTedCruz enemy foreign or domestic is an enemy
@SenTedCruz Would they prefer making them honorary US citizens instead?
@SenTedCruz Syrian refugees are fleeing because they don't support jihadists and don't want to live in a Caliphate.
@SenTedCruz I always thought renouncing was something a person does on their own behalf. You're the senator, I guess. But yeah. Sure. Do it.
@SenTedCruz and your not even a citizen-back to Canada where you belong
@SenTedCruz @RealBPhil @SenateDems are extreme radicals. They have no place in our Government. They refuse to protect the American citizens.
@SenTedCruz @BringTheFlag @SenateDems Dems are anti-American thru and thru.
@SenTedCruz @annie_amountain That really says it all, doesn't it Senator Cruz?
@SenTedCruz enough with the fear mongering!  Do something constructive for your constituents.
@SenTedCruz they'd do anything for a vote
@SenTedCruz Does shutting down the government count as jihad, Seniterrr? It should.
@SenTedCruz and what about whites who shoot innocent people in the name of christianity?
@SenTedCruz @RealBPhil How many of the Syrian refugees have top 5 wealthiest Muslim countries taken in? Correct answer Zero. Cited security
@SenTedCruz @RealBPhil Of course they did because it was a real bill with teeth and not Paul Ryan's bogus show vote.
@SenTedCruz Watched your interview on Louder with Crowder. Brilliant stuff. Only sorry I can't vote4u>I'm an Aussie.
@SenTedCruz not true NitWit
@SenTedCruz As a Constitionalist you should know Section 110 of Article III. of the Constitution already addresses treason #StopPosturing
@SenTedCruz  any surprise  the DEMOCOMMIES  would object to anything to protect the USA ?
@SenTedCruz WHY?!  No logic in Dems objection!
@SenTedCruz @SweetFreedom29 Those Dems should be remembered on how they voted when comes time for election.  But  won't happen
@SenTedCruz absolutely insane they didn't agree.
@SenTedCruz This sir, is because they consider Republicans the enemy, not Isis!
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber Unbelievable.....actually, no is isn't. We coddle those who want to wipe us off this good earth.
@SenTedCruz WHAAAT?  HAS HE LOST HIS MIND OR WHAAAAT IS HIS AGENDA?
@SenTedCruz isn't treason already punishable by death? Why revoke citizenship?
@SenTedCruz maybe the American people should declare a jihad against Washington. Washington is everything that is wrong with our country.

@SenTedCruz @WashingtonDCTea #DemsTransformUSAinto300MSoftTargets

@SenTedCruz THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUINING THIS COUNTRY.  THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AMERICAN DEATHS
@lindanye6615 @SenTedCruz really??? how do you figure?

@SenTedCruz Praise God!  Your calling is to protect Americans!  Thank you.
@SenTedCruz Each one should have to explain his/her opposition to this bill to constituents.
@SenTedCruz Why don't you generalize your bill renouncing citizenship for anyone caught doing any violent crime not just targeting #Muslims
@SenTedCruz The Democrats and libs are the Fearon gers that wish to take away all rights. NOT  Constitutional republicans following law.
@SenTedCruz What do you expect from lovers of sanctuary cities and people who don't care about Kate Steinle. Do you think they care???
@SenTedCruz Ted keep doing what you are doing somebody needs to actually be in touch with the people and speak as they would. CRUZ'16
@SenTedCruz that's okay, the Democrats just handed is the race.   Hope we can last that long to get them out.

@SenTedCruz grandstand much?
@SenTedCruz shouldn't we be more concerned about terrorists sneaking into US rather than coming here as refugees & secure the border now?
@SenTedCruz Americans must hold them accountable for not protecting US citizens, our national security, & our economy. @theblaze
@SenTedCruz Why, Why, Why.
@SenTedCruz are you serious?
@SenTedCruz how sad...
@SenTedCruz The only transparency in this administration is complete disdain for those who do not agree with him #ISIS

Stop whining princess...scared of orphans, children, & debate moderators!!
@SenTedCruz doesn't matter they let anyone come into and stay in this country anyway
@SenTedCruz Stupidest bill ever.  How about we renounce the citizenship of every congressman that can't do his job
@SenTedCruz ^once again #Progressives are #enabling our enemies abroad and #traitors here at home, there is #NO excuse!!!
@SenTedCruz @LFS7 surprising? #DemocRats are the #Communist party for the #USA
Maybe is because on 2% of terrorist activity due to Muslims @SenTedCruz & such bill is racist
@SenTedCruz That's OK, just prosecute them for treason and execute them
@SenTedCruz It is now a fact that the dems have become an adversary of the United States.
@SenTedCruz @SenatorReid and the rest are #traitors to #America and should be removed along with #POTUS #WakeUpAmerica #wakeupworld #tcot

@SenTedCruz Well, that speaks volumes about the Democrats, doesn't it?
.@SenTedCruz Like this guy?
@prosediva @SenTedCruz Well, at least he seems to be bipartisan in his political animosity, anyway.
@SenTedCruz that's because being a liberal democrat is a mental disorder...
@SenTedCruz That's because they would all lose their citizenship!
@SenTedCruz This the problem party line has replaced concern and commom sense for American. If they are Elected Vote against them!
