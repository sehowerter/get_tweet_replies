Likely states that will have the largest funding cuts, CT included. And you wonder why I've been screaming about CT economy. We're screwed
This is a "show". They will flip and support the bill. Just like last time. No "regular order" like @SenJohnMcCain said we need
Yup
@JohnKasich has never flipped.  He's always stood strong for compromise!
Heller has. Multiple times!!
Yep- as did @dougducey. This bill will greatly harm the people he governs, but he is more worried about "Repeal" promise than Healthcare!
G-E-N-O-C-I-D-E is now waiting to be added to your resume and portfolio @DeanHeller & @GovSandoval
But have any of these esteemed chief executive leaders read the bill? I'd like to know more about what's in it if it has a chance of passing
I hope you are backing our President. We voted for him because we want change and change he will bring
Thank you @JohnKasich
Stop trumpcare it only cares for insurance companies and CEO's
When are YOU going to support #MedicareForAll & stop shilling for profitable insurance companies while 29 million people lack healthcare?
in that 29 million ,,,omg yea when  INSURE ALL AMERICANS !
Most Americans support #singlepayer. But Chris Murphy chooses donations over what the people want. Big News!
Are they intending on revising it?
Go Gov. Charlie Baker from MA!
Republican governors?  That's a who's who list of Democrat heroes.

@senrobportman Are you listening? Do the right thing and vote NO on Graham Cassidy.
All they hear are the money counters going off in their reelection offices. Dirty money paying for little people's suffering.
Dirty money is the way of the Trump administration.
Why is he the only one people are criticizing constantly what about OB ?
He's NOT the only one. All Republicans: #NoRepeal
Get it in writing
My governor is a as bad as Trump. Thank God I have @SenatorCollins 
@SenAngusKing  fighting for Maine people
Anyone that votes for this pile of  is literally committing murder.
It most certainly is and thank God!! 
Must stop this new attack. Call the Senators. Kill this bill.
Memberso of a Republican  party work on recovery of  their Mummy
Governors with balls!
@MassGovernor @SenWarren @RepJoeKennedy Sir I respectfully request you join the other govs and reject the latest #CassidyGraham bill
Why? What's going to happen to Obamacare ? Where is the money coming from? Why bail out insurance companies? They made billions last year
Turns out opioid crisis in OH creates sympathetic GOP for healthcare programs.
.@ChrisMurphyCT Can anyone reason with, persaude, do anything with the Arizona Gov? As he goes, so goes McCain and too likely the bill.
And New Hampshire.
Gina Raimondo is terrific. Not sure why she's not better known.
She may be terrific, but she is a Democratic Gov of Rhode Island.
Yes, and RI is a tiny state. I'm just saying I'm surprised she doesn't get more play/ isn't a louder voice in this sort of thing.
RI is not the smallest state (pop wise), but yeah. She also made news on #DACA the other day. But for #GrahamCassidyBill R govs important
Doug Ducey voted "Yes" and took away healthcare for millions in Arizona. Enjoy your term as Governor, it will be your last you bastard
@senrobportman you know what to do. Stand by your governor @JohnKasich and do the right thing for Your constituents!
Thank you!
Turns out not all Republicans are bad then......
Caveat he's not GOP but it's a red state.
And Montana thank you @GovernorBullock
Today I joined a bipartisan group of governors urging Congress to not consider the Cassidy-Graham amendment.
Larry Hogan of MD too.
@PattiKimble Please thank them 4 us. Where is Collins? I respect @SenatorCollins
Thank you governors for carrying. Help convince @GOP senators to do same
Pennsylvania @GovernorTomWolf
@Coco_Wms Senator are we still living in America??? Can u check & let us know please ?
Maryland too
Where's AZ, Maine?
Heller (the author) has already lied about this repeatedly. Y'all can do what you want. As far me? I ain't buying his bullsh*t ANYMORE!
The majority is in favor.real simple.
My home state is Ohio, Despite not being a Republican, I have to say our governor,  Kasich, truly cares about the people of Ohio.
You mean there's some Republicans out there with a heart????
Charlie Baker would be on the streets any other way.

@GovernorDeal @GovWalker why have you 2 not come out against it? Are your personal kickbacks if it passes to good to pass up?
@GovAbbott Texas stands to lose billions & most Texans will lose the majority of their healthcare,  including our vets. Tell them to vote no
@DeereShopping   Republican governors have more sense than Congressional republicans
But of course not Illinois’ governor, Rauner the Useless
Now if only our Senators can grow some knads
Let's hope that enough republican senators can see that this is the right thing to do.
IS @JohnKasich PART OF THE KOCH BROTHERS DONOR NETWORK?
Can you convince Sen. McCain to not listen to his governor?
@PattiKimble Alaska? That's a good sign?
Too bad they don't get a vote.
#GrahamCassidy
@DeanHeller. Doesn't look like a very positive review from these guys.
@robportman VOTE NO!
It's a start.
Thank you, #TheResistance. Keep up the phone calls to your representatives.
But do @senrobportman & @SenDeanHeller care? Did somebody #quidproquo @dougducey to #flipflop for repugnant #GrahamCassidy? @SenJohnMcCain
@nj11forchange and sadly only Alaska' s matters.
Thank you!
Good deal. Keep up the pressure. Trumpcare is deathcare
Maine.. @SenSusanCollins 
#noGrahamCassidy 
VOTE NO
Heros to millions!
That is one reason they dont want single payer insurance where would they get the kick backs
Probably won't matter to the gop senators
You forgot New York
Find a f'kin solution to the problem Murph! The problem with all of you people is you identify problems & bitch but have NO solutions!
Thank you, @GovSandoval !!  Please ask @DeanHeller to do what's best for NV. He stood with you June 27th & agreed to VOTE NO & lied again
He's a liar. A rich one, at our expense and guess what? He's got a Golden Insurance Plan paid for by WE THE PEOPLE!!

I see now. This could turn enough in Congress against the bill to kill it dead. But maybe they'll take that risk to get a team GOP "win".
The DISABLED like my 19 year old severely disabled son are in big trouble with this is heinous bill!
Too bad they don't vote in Congress.
NH's did, too.
Very big and GOOD news!  Need to put a stake in this repeal Ocare effort  once and for all and those who are behind it need to pay at polls.
Pennsylvania tooo @GovernorTomWolf
Too bad Kasich's Lieutenant Gov. feels otherwise, she must be defeated in '18.
@rachelbtiven and @MaddowBlog and I @KantorRandy Support Health care legislation For Vulnerable American s Including Disabled Children
The newest #Trumpcare bill is WORSE than the previous ones. #VoteNoTrumpcare
How many were against the last plan, that was approved by all Repub members except Collins, Murkowski and McCain?
God Bless each and everyone of you!
Are you telling me John Kasich, who pledged to support the GOP presidential nominee, is against #TrumpCare!  That is BIG NEWS indeed.
#MAGA
If Govs are against then don't their state Senators have an obligation to vote no?
Good!!
Be nice if govs got to vote.

Their on the list with you to be voted out
Where you at @LarryHogan?

Today, I released the following statement in response to the Graham-Cassidy health care bill: 
Where are the govs of AZ MS GA WV TN KY ... ?
This is the worst version of #Trumpcare yet & the sneakiest.
Shame on you @LindseyGrahamSC
Did the asshole nevada governor change his mind?
If it wasn't pure ideologism, which Graham has now admitted it is, it would make a difference.
Call your reps asap
don't forget Maryland!
This bill proves that we can never count on GOP members of congress regaining their sanity. GOP governors need to take control of party.
Thank you
@Hope012015 
Good
Too bad they can't vote in the senate.
To bad Missouri Governor not on the list!
Reality check. They have no vote.
Just hope to God that their senators feel the same.
Oh how I wish Wisconsin were on that list!
Because when you come down to it, #Trump doesn't really care does he? Nope. OXYMORON = #Trumpcare
Big..Yuge news ! If any member of Congress votes for this, they are just mean. Just stop this already...get to work fixing/tweaking the ACA.
And Pennsylvania
Ohio does not have a republican gov. @JohnKasich is a democrat no matter his lies.
The Gov of Alaska is an independent.
Turns out, gov. @BrianSandoval  has the interests of nevadans first. Hey @SenDeanHeller this is how you do it.
Bill Walker of AK is an independent.
Okay #OREGON#WASHINGTON. we want to hear a BIG NO FROM YOU!!! No on republicans Healthcare bill!!!
Please add Gov. Hogan of MD to the list.

Another one: Maryland GOP Gov. @LarryHogan, up for reelection in 2018, comes out against Graham-Cassidy. #MDGov 
EXCELLENT
@MassGovernor GOP Charlie Baker makes decisions on the issues as it will affect MA residents Hope Lisa Murkowski follows her Gov's lead
Unfortuantelynfor the Dems, the arizona Gov already endorsed (mccain)
Colorado too!
They don't listen to their governors! don't listens the HC people! They don't listen to the people! They have their eyes on the $
Then just allow Obamacare to implode and hurt millions of people! What is wrong with you Politicians! Voted in to help the American People!
@senrobportman vote NO on this bill!!
Meaningless news.
Last time I checked Senator, governors don't get a vote.
don't forget new hampshire!
(202) 224-3121
Tell senators vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill & no using kids as human shields. Don't harm veterans, seniors, disabled.
Praise GOD!
Could somebody explain to me why we have to BEG our senators to listen to us?! @senrobportman ?!
GOPs have to kill Obamacare to give each of top 1% $80,000/yr tax cuts. GOP  slashes social programs - http://abcn.ws/2tmfJky    via @ABC
@senrobportman  doesn't care what we need or want. Not that he talks to us. It's been more than 1,500 days since his last #Townhall
Please folks find some decency! Any bill needs discussion and bi-partisanship. @GOP @SenatorLankford @JimInhofe
The governor of Alaska is technically an independent with a Democratic lieutenant governor.
@GovRoyCooper -- please take a stand against this unfair legislation.
@lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenSusanCollins #VoteNOGrahamCassidy millions are counting on you to protect our healthcare #SaveOurCare
Please don't fail the American people counting on you
 Many thanks for speaking out
Good.  Thank you.
Call your representatives...keep calling them...
What?  Dean Heller's governor is publicly against it?
If you would support single payer instead of pro-Nazi junkets to Ukraine with your pal McCain, maybe we wouldn't need this debate.
Kind of need Arizona too since McCain lost his ability to think for himself.
Those States are waiting for the Feds to give them a complete bailout on the failed ACA, took VT.4 years to get up and running failing awful
Just waiting on @senrobportman to denounce it
...but @SenJohnMcCain indicated that his support would be contingent upon his own state's governor... Have we heard from Mr. Ducey, yet?!?
There are still some reasonable voices in our government.  Hopefully they will not be drowned out by the partisan GOP members in Congress
@senrobportman  Our Gov @JohnKasich is telling you this h/c plan bad for your constituents. Do you care?
Yes! Now if only the gov from Arizona would do the same!!!
Maryland too.
They need Medicaid expansion to take care of citizen they can't take care of otherwise. Too many #opioidepidemic problems
Add Maryland to the list
Get your senators in line .. do for your state .. do for your country
call senators. Ask for CBO score. Ask for Hearings. Delay vote past 9-30. Then they will need 60 votes. Let's go for it
#InGodWeTrust #TrumpIsNotGod #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #TrumpIsRocketMan #TrumpisDepraved #TrumpIsRealCrisis
good I need my medicaid
Do the right thing for the American people Integrity & character 
Bill Walker's an independent but was once a Republican.
Can't believe more Governors come out against it. What about California, Washington, New York, etc?
@dew_drop16 senators from GOP. Stop trumpcare. NOW
Wake me up when the Republican Senators from said states do same. Until then, I am meditating upon their demise.
Republican Govs from Ohio, Nevada, Alaska, Vermont, Massachusetts come out against new #TRUMPCARE bill. Big news.
"Make preexisting conditions great again!" --GrahamCassidy
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy  @SenDeanHeller This is truly a "GET SICK AND DIE" Plan. Just so you can fund the tax cuts for the Rich.
Where is @LarryHogan of Maryland? We are watching Mr. Hogan. You committed to protecting Marylanders Healthcare
And Maryland!
Where is OUR governor...Dannel Malloy??
Does that mean Portman will vote against it?
@senrobportman doesn't care about us... remember @BetsyDeVosED ? Sold his vote to her... he'll sell this one too.
But the governor of Arizona supports it, which provides McCain the cover to vote for it.
What about you, @GovernorDeal? Do you care about the people of #Georgia? Oh, yeah, you signed #campuscarry so apparently not!
and Maryland
They all bet big on Medicaid expansion, just like Connecticut did, you idiot!

Of course they are going to whine when they bet wrong.
What does @GovChristie have to say about the bill? @starledger @trentontimes @ThePressofAC
THANK GOD.
My god Chris Murphy I found this, Cassidy is just a crook, a mean one. https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/23/fighting-affordable-care-act-louisiana-town-hall …
No sh!t
Keep on fighting until Sept 30th
I hope these man are actually thinking about the health of all Americans...the people who pay their bills and vote them in-or Out.
Can you share the letter?
Arizona?
 please don't let this pass. #healthcareforall
Now Senators in those states...Act and vote ACCORDINGLY!  Thank you Senator Murphy
An amendment needs to be added to bill: remove health care benefit for entire Congress if this bill passes. Sorry it punishes the innocent.
And Maryland!
That is encouraging.
Nevada and Alaska are anyway
What's up with Arizona?
Rocket Man so happy to hear about this!
Will the repug senators of those states follow suit though?
Nope.
Buried lede:

Vermont has a Republican Governor?!
He doesn't know he is a Republican be he ran as one!
The bill is an act of terrorism.
Thank you, @MassGovernor!
Yay!!!!  Is it dead?  I've lost track
Not yet.
Keep calling!
Does anyone in the @GOP controlled congress care, though?
