Why don't the media cover this.
@anuvid 
Still don't trust Cory...he's been bought and pais for
I must confess I don't know enough about him but thanks I will look into that
He's definitely a corporate dem
Still have 100 of him for every Trump pick
Wish we had 100 Bernies
Not Trumpcare, Ryan-Rhino GOP plan. Get facts straight! Stop misleading the people.
@CarolWa41822202   speak 
@CoryBooker I've lived in #UK 41 yrs; what unites Republicans/Dems abroad is universal health care. Why can't US have this?
We Americans are greedy & impatient. Everybody have the same thing across the board? Never.
I used to think highly of PR. What a sell out.
Never expected the Speaker to be so spineless. It's sad.
... Of course. No bias here. Heheheheh...
Trump care is the worst.
What's you solution? A lot of criticism of but zero idea of how to fix it
@duhgurlz
@RepNewhouse 
How is this better?  I demand you come home and hold a town hall to explain to us why this is better?
I live in Florida. Do I need to call @marcorubio on a daily basis to let him know I am opposed to this?
Yes, you do. It's important
@d_battinelli We were promised so much with failing Obamacare & Dems. Why should we believe you again?
I live in a state with only one provider. My health care costs are $2268 a month or 1/3 my household income. How is this good?
@guynormanbee a novel concept for you lame asses. Free market in healthcare. I know it makes you irrelevant but....
ALL people should have access to good health care. Not just the ones who can afford outrageous fees.
nobody's labor is another's by right and prices (in a free market) are set by voluntary exchange. Fees are high now
the prices of health insurance are not set by voluntary exchange tho. They have been set by greed
so its like Tricare/VA/Medicare?  naw u just want everyone on Medicaid but shift burden from State to Federal.
Trumpcare will cost my grandchildren their insurance thanks Trump.
@DianeRosemond Just gonna leave this here... http://ln.is/ninaillingworth.com/s5FL9 …
Trump care; I'm ok, you're not okay, that's ok.
@CoryBooker work in a family restaurant. ACA has been awful for owners and workers. Lost a lot of votes last election.
That anecdote doesn't mean it has been awful for everyone else. Majority like the law. Just fix it
you shouldn't give to people by ruining the lives of others. Restaurant owners could not afford it.
Obama care not looking so bad now is it - said America.
@CoryBooker sounds like the same argument the reps had over Obamacare, sounds like scare tactic / political garbage to me
Then you aren't thinking very hard or critically.
can we all have same #healthcare #congress has now? #UniversalHealthCare = #Humanrights #EleanorRoosevelt #RepealAndReplace
;How@ talking> BigPharma 2 Booker=how you help block < costs meds+that lost by only 5 votes (13 DP blk it)
@Reaforreal11 , it's so funny, 7 years didn't do anything, now he's got all the answers. Another reason for TERM LIMITS
@d_battinelli
you should take this matter to the president before doing this  your tactics are wrong
It's the job of a new potus to break bread with the opposition on policy issues not the other way around
@CoryBooker CALL IT REPUBLICARE
Or perhaps "Commie Care"?
why are dems branding it the same way reps branded obamacare? dumb then, dumb now.  just call it NO-CARE
.@SenBookerOffice @OccupyDemocrats DID you read it this time?  LOLOLOLOL
Why Don't You Go Back To NJ. Your State Is In Some Much Trouble.Always On The News.Obama Is Gone Get Over It.
@comebackdecade from. Ppl arent losing insurance they have cancelled due to increase prices my dads went from 250 to 1000
GOP The Hard Truth: Many healthy poor people vote Democrat-Dead poor people don't vote. #Trumpcare ?#TrumpDontCare #Resist
According to the Trump Troop dead people, do indeed, vote. Lots of Corpses. Many. Great voting Corpses.
A Math major yr not !! Very weak premise & quite frankly very embarrassing the somehow u r US Senator !!
Tou have 5 followers Humpty Trumpty. That makes you unqualified. By the way. He didn't do any math. #epicfail
@Thesixler still never voting for this deer-in-the-headlights corporate shill, a-hole.
your whining and bitching caused this
I voted, donated and worked locally for HRC.  Dunno what ur saying.
also I love harmonquest.
that comma made it look like I was calling you an a-hole.  Booker's the asshole, not you.
Unbelievable! The GOP healthcare replacement bill includes a provision to give insurance executives a $400M tax break.
@EJLandwehr Trump/Ryan Care-to-Die? UnHealth Plan. So, really doesn't need anything to do w uninsured
Very well explained Senator. Thank you!
@VickyDege
Donald Trump is "Supposed To" be a Business Man. 
Where is the "Business Plan" for Providing HEALTHCARE to Everyone at a reasonable price? 
@GetWisdomDude
@GetWisdomDude WELL OF COURSE.  WE HAVE TO FIND MONEY FOR THOSE HUGE TAX BREAKS. THOSE BILLIONAIRES NEED RELEIFE.
On a lighter note, is it a fad for congressmen to hold powerpoints/white boards in a rolled up button down?
Very doubtful its worse than obamacare. I work in healthcare and obamacare is seriously a bad joke.
Thank you for breaking this down.
ryan shld have tried ur *simple* approach. aye
pls stop pandering like you care. Go get your WS dollars like the good boy u are, and stop "caring" about consumers.
Thank you! Facts delivered clear & accurate. Pls get this msg out to all! Empower others to do the same myself included
the only reason Rp's want to get rid of Obamacare is that it was proposed by a black Dem president it was their plan stolen
@JamesPurefoy Trumpcare? What's that? I thought it was called TrumpDoesntCare
PLEASE PRESENT DEMOCRATIC FIX. DEMS NEED TO CONTRAST THE APPROACHES
thank you senator Booker.
@AnaWalt60150865 @realDonaldTrump I  say do nothing and let Obama care implode all by itself.
@Weingar2Marilyn   Block and resist and obstruct Cory!!! Shut down the government if you have to!!! Play hard ball
#GOPGames not to allow Americans a chance to give input. Listen to The People @HouseGOP @SenateGOP 

Messing with lives!
BOOKER FOR PRESIDENT
This was concise and understandable. CAN we STOP them? I'm feeling tense about this!
You're irresponsibly misinforming people. You know this is only the reconciliation bill to repeal, not replacement portion!
Why aren't Dems working on a plan to fix ACA?  Show Americans who is in their side.
But the electorate learned to hate #Obamacare! How was that done?
Big Pharma is the Big Problem in US
Fight for us Cory.
Thank you for always standing up and boldly speaking out against the Trump agenda!
correction: it is #TrumpDoesntCare
You Dems need to step it up. Get the others to step up and speak out otherwise we may be in hell for 8 years.
@samswey #BernieWouldHaveWon #Medicare4All
here's a lesson for you @VP
Please fight against this! I am a cancer survivor and my cancer could come back at any time. Protect the vulnerable!
"GOP DeathCare", making the Insurance Industry rich again. Breaking news: Mortuaries order more coffins. RIP sick America.
The #GOP has been dreaming of hurting Americans for years
Thank you sir #leadbyexample #unitefight #PowertotheWomen #powertothepeople #makeonefist #wearethis #healthcare #love
did you really name that "Trump care' too funny!!
Did you support Senator Sanders's effort to lower prescription drug prices?
#JustAsking
@SenBookerOffice
trumpCareLess u mean.
FACTS PLS-not what u think will happen-ACA was a disaster & it was crammed down r throats knowing full well u screwed us.
It seems @SenBookerOffice the entire #onceGOP agenda = Those With More Than Enough to get rid of Those Without Enough as quickly as they can
thank you for speaking out!
#TrumpNoCare
@Eugene_V_Tooms What is most amazing is that the @GOP is willing to kill Americans just to give the rich a tax break.
We all knew that before they even started working on their "plan."
yet they r shovng this crap down our throats &pocket books having 2pay more&more& more.disgusting!! Thnk u 4 sticking w/us
@mooncatadams makes rich even richer. how will they get all that blood money into heaven?
the 3 reasons that he'll definitely do it.
thanks for spelling it out. Take a look @iwf.
@PrincessBravato Sounds like a plan!
@CoryBooker Combat Trump on his road trip to KY. the GOP healthcare is a mess. Tell What will happen TO U if this passes
@cnn @msnbc @nytimes They call it repeal&replace its not: its steal and gut& charge poor&elderly more
Yea but you're just using facts.Youll see.After they repeal there will be many ppl w/o coverage like they say.
Give him *some* credit though, he's got sleeves rolled up trying to explain policy. Ivanka must've stood him up for lunch.
So, your best argument is Trump's shitty plan is a little worse than Obama's shitty plan? There's a politician for you!
They want something, anything that Obama can't get credit for they don't care about helping the people
@JamesPurefoy of republicans wanted a plan in place. This us the Shit show they are trying to roll out.
REGULATE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES! #universalcoverage
@JamesPurefoy nobody is saying that ACA is flawless. The Republicans wanted it gone then they found that the majority of
@rweingarten @realDonaldTrump so concerned with protecting wealthy who can pay for insurance. < people & < coverage
@SNPRPRT2 Trump is avoiding the #trumpcare name. If he believes in it, he needs to own it.
@CoryBooker I am frightened, Senator. Can't get by on SS minus medicare premium now. My son died in NBergen-join him sooner
@CoryBooker  It should be called #trumpdoesntcare
Thank u 4 retweeting this @Alyssa_Milano
sign the petition fight back
does it make sense to economists?
Trump and GOP are only concerned about money going into their pockets and their friends. Please keep fighting for the rest!
I don't need a $1.5K tax credit. I need sick people to not have to drive schoolbuses or handle food.
STOP STROKING HIS EGO BY CALLING IT TRUMPCARE!!! #AHCA #SWAMPCARE
@pkni And perhaps the worse offense, is that the plan would gut #Medicaid as we know it
Terrific plan if you're a GOP legislator because it doesn't apply to you. If it did, you can be sure it would be defeated.
EVERYBODY MUST MARCH AND TELL THE GOP THEY LOST  YOUR VOTE!! OH THAT WILL SHAKE THEM!!!
Waaaaayyy more expensive. Hey, GOP ! Not everyone is a CEO.
@WendySzy
true- but unless we address The Public's health/exercise habits & reel in big pharm, medical cost- system will implode
unless each and every senator is willing to drop their benefits and sign up for this new health plan, it should not pass
@CoryBooker @phiaxann
lol #racisttrumpcare sucks @maddow @JoyAnnReid @jaketapper @repjohnlewis @Lawrence @CharlesMBlow @donlemon @ananavarro
DonTCare
shouldn't we be calling g this Trumpdontcare?
the creators of #trumpcare don't want #trumpcare branded #trumpcare which is why #trumpcare is on repeat here. #trumpcare
out is one of three. He is just causing trouble. Don't listen to him.
No one shall be FORCED to have healthcare period. It's wrong but I understand Democrats have no common sense.
Cory booker nothing short of a pain. I believe he is just running his mouth to get air time.  The bill that has come
It's all GREED! It's all about control. Like Obama did not do it? You do or else pay a fine?
Well Obamacare is no better. So can you say Obamacare was not $$$? Who can afford $500+Prem? Then the Ded is $500+
.@SenBookerOffice Trump & Regressive Republicans don't care about our health, they care about the financial health of the wealthy. #nvfr
How can he be impeached?
Keep sending this out!!!#Trumpcare
thank you! #BrokenPromises are the hallmark of the GOP in power
we need to get the word out ASAP
Share this w/ those Trumpets. Help this see this isn't good for the country. Break thru the denial.
Sounds about  right, as I'm convinced that #TrumpCARELESS
Trumpcare kills.
Thank you for fighting #TrumpCare
bc that's what President Bannon wants
Reply to @SenBookerOffice Thank you for fighting #TrumpCare #LessForMore
not to mention that worst parts won't go into effect until AFTER next pres. election...Trumpsters would still vote 4 him
hope this very simple for trumpist to understand..
2) don't get health care neither sure members of Congress
#RyanCare pls call it RyanCare! I doubt Trump knows anything about it!
#Trumpcare really means #TrumpDoesNotCare
I Believe that somebody should sponsor a bill that says that members of Congress no longer have health insurance if we
I pay for my own BCBS health insurance. And proud of it. 
Govt can't make a simple pencil
Small wonder they can't do health insurance

#TrumpDontCare
- Cory run 2020 !!!!!!  The country needs you  
There hasn't been a moment when the GOP wasn't looking out for themselves & we were getting hosed in the process!
ppl can't afford their meds because of the price gauging by the pharmaceutical companies n u n others let it happen smdh
I'm sorry sir but I have a hard time taking u n others seriously while u cave to big business n screw the citizens
Thank you, Cory! Regards.
What I would like to know is where is all the money that is governed by the COMPTROLLERS of every State.
Yes... but a small price to pay to give a handful of the wealthiest Americans a tax cut they don't need. Right @GOP?
YOU ARE THE MAN!
@anti_orange1 thanks cool high-school teacher Booker who inspired us to achieve our dreams.
Mr. Booker I Vote for you to be President 2020!!
What is with that talking point that you can have an ins card, but it is worthless?
@therealzanetta Im as good as dead.I've worked HARD my entire life.Owned businesses & employed others. Now @ 63 I'm screwed
but my taxes are lower, and I'm rich rallying cry of supporters
covers less procedures, less medication and too many prior authorizations will be needed for basic healthcare
Then fix it!
But Obamacare made my insurance cost go up, restricted my coverage, and made health care mandatory. Thats not reform either
To quote software developers "It's a feature! Not a bug!"
@kharyp If 50-plus Employers are 'off the hook,' how many of the 'heartless employers' will drop their coverage? #Trumpcare
people that voted trump are sick as fuck and now they will experience what they voted for...
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump We will be rising up against you.  #Hypocrites #LiarInChief #UnChristian
btw it's NOT Trump care, but FREEDOM CARE
