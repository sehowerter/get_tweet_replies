@GOP @jasoninthehouse: Did @HillaryClinton break the law? 
FBI : She did not. 
@MustDeportTrump @JeffFlake
@MustDeportTrump @GOP @jasoninthehouse @HillaryClinton @JeffFlake
then why are you not supporting Donald Trump? Big mistake for Republican Party
I think his tweet makes it clear why he's not supporting Trump.
how? It sure ain't loyalty to him s party
it's because of moments like "lock her up" that he is not supporting Trump. That and Trump's racism of course.
that didn't start until recently after FBI Director remarks. Sen Flake was against Trump before that.
Perhaps Flake realizes that the good of  one's country trumps (hee) loyalty to a party that is going down in flames
you actually think Trump is worse 4 America than HRC? If you don't vote for Trump, you are giving 2 votes to HRC
Trump's NATO comments shows what a disaster he'd be. Want WW3? Sure, vote for Trump
if you can't support your nationally elected candidate, you need not comment on the campaign.
You have a responsibility to comment when you see this kind of injustice.
what injustice specifically?
Jeff Flake can have any opinion he wants. You seem to be saying that an R had to vote R. When was that law passed?
1912
she is the "shark" and when she is in jail there will be parties nation wide. now ur out, draining the swamp is on the way. ur name fits u
Hillary lies Comey proved IT to Congress.
send classified e mail, & received emails.
does belong in prison, she broke the law multiple times
Are you a liar or completely ignorant regarding the Clintons many well documented crimes?
Call for Justice! Lock Her Up NOW!
Uh, the FBI Director said as much in his statement that she violated the law of the land. HRC a friend?
maybe you should be Flake
Jeff, maybe look up what "jump the shark" means before you go misusing it.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNNPolitics You should be voted out of office! You are a traitor to the RNC and WeThePeople. #RINO
She should be imprisoned...people who've committed lesser crimes have been imprisoned. Can you say Teflon!?!?  @JeffFlake @HillaryClinton
Yep, wouldn't want to set a precedent indicting federal politicians. Too many defendants would clog our courts.
do you have any idea how many counts of murder and treason she is guilty of? you clearly don't. RESEARCH DUDE. its your friend
Back TRUMP to get Republicans in control again..Hillary & Obama will take us down.By not backing TRUMP-Your helping Hillary win!
Senator, your party jumped the shark decades ago.  When they decided to hop into bed with southern racists like David Duke
It's treason, and puts the nation at risk, so, yea, it should be investigated, and if there's evidence, prison. If it was a fair world...but
do you think The Clinton Crime Family foundation is legit?  Just bad accounting?  No intent?
FLAKE!
She belongs in prison and, I think anyone who tries to block or shield her from prosecution deserves jail time 2.
She is a t.r.a.i.t.o.r.
Deserves f.i.r.i.n.g. s.q.u.a.d.
You need to Support our Candidate,Because if Hillary wins, America,with her Supreme Court, (Will be finished,for Decades) Trump
Mr. FLAKE, is this word a conservative word with you, "c'mon"? This is why we need to get rid of politicians!
Jeff comes from a long line of flakes.the name was changed years ago.Thinking Flake was better then crazy
CLINTON'S SHOULD BE IN PRISON!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LYRUOd_QoM&feature=share … #LockHerUp  #Corruption
Yes she DOES belong in prison. Many have been and are there for much less than she has done.
--Let's do both! She needs to lose, and then go to prison. #NoSharksNecessary
Boss @RepStevenSmith so @JeffFlake doesn't think @HillaryClinton putting classified Intel on the 'net is illegal?
.@HillaryClinton now belongs in prison? C'mon. We can make the case that she shouldn't be elected without jumping the shark.
<what an A$$> @HillaryClinton
if it were you or @mcuban that wiped a sever, sent classified emails, had aides plead the 5th, you'd be in jail. @HillaryClinton
Comey said & showed that the exact opposite is true but you can keep pretending otherwise.
@JeffFlake @HillaryClinton
Jeff Flake should be recalled by we that voted for him. Disgrase to our party
How are you still a Republican?
so if you do t think Clinton should be in prison you're not a real Republican?
double negative. weak!
let me try again: So if you DON'T think she should go to prison, you're not a real Republican?
#ourchildrenarewatching
Hillary is just too important 2Wall Street & Foreign Governments to hold her 2same standards as little ppl. @sean_tobin #Corrupt
She belongs in jail.
Was there an indictment, trial, and conviction that the whole world didn't notice? Or are you just spreading manure?
the question is, if someone else did what she did, would they go to jail? Or at least be punished?
To be very clear, a Republican such as Powell and Rice would not even be investigated. You are buying RW BS.
actually I'm not. It's common sense. Rules should apply to everyone, even if you're a Clinton
That's true. So since she has not been indicted there is no crime. You need to stop acting like she is guilty.
at the very least she's incompetent. Her actions risked lives. She's guilty of that, that was proven
and if it had been anyone else, that would have been call for punishment, but she's a Clinton
Do you think you would get away with lying to the FBI and to Congress about violating the records act? Doubtful
Jumping the shark? First if all, I don't think that metaphor means what you think it does. 2nd, are you serious?
so you're saying she hasn't broken the law? She's not any better than anyone else. Same rules should apply
I dare you to install a private email server at home & then send, receive & store sensitive classified material.@JeffFlake @HillaryClinton
Nothing illegal. If you disagree, cite the statute. I'll wait. Put up. 

 #ourchildrenarewatching
I am assuming that you can read. I am waiting. Do you need a writer to come up with something witty?@Paul_News @JeffFlake @HillaryClinton
I don't see your reference to a statute she violated, or your evidence that she violated it. Try.
I know it's hard, but try to muster up enough #braincells to figure this out. Not #prosecuting does not imply innocence.@Paul_News #Hillary
Again I'll take that as "I can't cite. I can only gossip." 9 investigations. Cite 1.

 #ourchildrenarewatching
#trumpsunstable
Willful ignorance.@Paul_News
Protecting ur prejudgments. Again I'll take that as "I can't cite. I can only gossip."

.@JeffFlake @Fava @HillaryClinton Before you address the calls for her to be imprisoned, maybe talk about those calling for her hanging?
You should be a demonrat, flake.
Should have been in prison for years.
Christie didn't make a case. He just flapped his gums.
get some balls & support the next President #Trump2016 Leader
#Patriot
#Communicator
#Negotiator
#Truthful
she should be. Sorry. You like breathing. She's not above the law
but seems thats all they wanted 2 do complete side show an embarrassment
consider that shark jumped. The new Jordan logo, actually.
apparently not
Thanks, politics should be about issues and finding common ground to move forward on. Too ugly, out there
We need more like you, Mr. Flake. We're opponents, not ENEMIES. #AboveTheFray
Do you disagree with the 56% of Americans who believe @HillaryClinton should have been indicted?
Dude,  pack your shit.  Arizona voters are gonna be sending you home.  You're a disgrace.  RINO
she does and it's sad u don't support it or stand up fully for ur party.
The director stated himself that other within the gov't would be charged if they did the same how not her
jump the shark the only one jumping the shark is you flake
Yeah, that particular shark got jumped a LONG time ago. Once a candidate starts name-calling, it's over.
How are u Republican? U seem sane & not full of hate, which has been your party since Reagan
don't chime in on OUR movement ...You are the complete antithesis 2 what the @realDonaldTrump movement is about...tick tock
you cannot be thrilled with Trump and still not defend Hillary on Twitter, you fraud.
dude, she mishandled classified information. This has been proven. Others have been locked up. #ruleoflaw
The truth is the truth and you are just a flake.........
c'mon Jeff.  What she did is summed up in one word well, maybe two (if you count Benghazi), treason and murder.
members of the us gov't that intentionally mishandle classified information should absolutely go to prison, yes
Yes Jeff you've been so open minded about Trump we Conservatived should ease off Hillary
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @CNN
That is in NO WAY jumping the shark.., ANYONE else that had done that WOULD BE IN JAIL...
Senator, you did it again. Thank you for being reasonable and mature. One of the most respectable @GOP Senators.
love to see my senator is rational!!! Well said and 100% agree
you better watch what you abt your nut jobs cohorts, you gonna get primaried
@mcuban @HillaryClinton She belongs in prison.
Sanity!
Thank you Senator for reminding folks  we do not live in a Banana Republic @HillaryClinton
Drumph has 4000 pending lawsuits and child rape and no one mentions it.
Jeff you really should make your case louder. Lots of republicans preparing to leave the party
thank you!
that is just presciou s as seeing as how you and McCain sold native land to foreigners!
She endangered every American with her abuse of the law.Jail is the minimum. Anyone else is in jail for much less."LOCK HER UP!"

Thank  you Senator Flake. As someone from AZ, it's heartening to hear intelligent discourse from you. Thank you!
Hillary broke MULTIPLE laws and SHOULD be in Prison FOR LIFE! If you don't think so, YOU are an IDIOT!
A little late for that one!
how about you standing up for DECENCY, not the 'party looking bad'?
You're just now realizing your party has been taken over by mean spirited kooks? I wish you the best, Senator.
Thank you for having (and being willing to display) a calm and sane attitude. Wish more on both sides were like you.
Thank you, Senator Flake, for showing some sanity and decency.
she committed multiple felons pal including perjury, wake up
she doesn't? why not? bec she's special? laws are not for her? why don't u come clean and switch parties?
Well when you have no positive ideas to offer you just have to make shit up to throw that you hope sticks.
pay any attention to Hillary's crimes at all or are you too busy changing your 'R' to 'D'? Or whitening you teeth
the FBI director already made the case that she should be in prison #lockherup #crookedHillary
but her "careless" actions with TS and SAP data proves otherwise Jeff...  Just Saying... Lost Trust...
It's odd you who said "I have to mow my lawn" is the one asking others not to jump the shark...very weird..
@SashaTofiq @HillaryClinton She's gonna kick Donald Trumps ass
I'm going to agree with you becos hillary is my last chance at legacy.
Anybody else would be in Prison.  Along w/ many in those email chains. She cannot be president...
TS and SAP data on unclas private email servers cause more than "exceptionally GRAVE DAMAGE" to U.S. Sad U don't see that!
Bravo! A voice of reason. 
@Redrues @HillaryClinton go join the DEMs where you belong you RINO wuss.
talking to RINO Flake not you.
well said....except for maybe you the GOP is full of sadistic, bitter and misogynistic men
Introducing @JeffFlake , non-insane Republican.
.@HillaryClinton now belongs in prison? C'mon. We can make the case that she shouldn't be elected without jumping the shark.
@BillWeirCNN @JeffFlake @HillaryClinton I am liking our Senator
Yeah, indisputable 110 felonies should just be ignored. . . . @HillaryClinton
- Had Chris Christie not started this negative disgusting thing this wouldn't have happened
Yeah, @JeffFlake, if you think that's bad, how about the Trump staffer saying today that HRC should be executed? #LovelyPartyYouHaveThere
Yes,  @HillaryClinton, does belong in prison. Any sailor I served with who treated classified material as she did would be.
#jumptheshark doesn't mean what you think it means.
Too late for that Jeff, your buddies past that point last night.
Sorry but majority of the GOP stopped being reasonable a long time ago. Now, it's all about creating fiction.
No. If Dems were held to the rule of law she would be in prison long ago and you know it, Flake.
You hold the shark. I'll hold the knife. Get a grip. Grow up.#Hillary4Prison
Too late. The GOP is dying.
He might as well change his party now. He's just digging the hole for re-election in AZ. Maybe that's his plan.....
Some people do ont want to make america great
what about these 6 fed laws that should be sufficient, IF the rule of law mattered

infowars
decency and civility have jumped the shark already it seems...this is the aftermath
belongs in prison?  Low Base mentality but since that's all the GOPs got, no policy & a sick twisted platform..
Unfortunately, your opinion does not fit with the new GOP.  The party of Reagan is dead...it is something else now.
Yes. Hillary belongs in prison with any other traitor who puts our classified info in a dangerous position. Don't forget Benghazi
one of you party said she should be hung- like watching Salem witch trials - or Hitler brainwashing the Germans
dangling modifier. She has to jump the shark in order to get elected?

I applaud the sentiment, but grammar.
Hi @JeffFlake, have you heard of @Al_Baldasaro? Asking for a friend. @HillaryClinton
Your thoughts on another prominent Republican Trump advisor advocating killing Hillary Clinton? http://bit.ly/29NuRd 
these r the same folks who said #melaniatrumpspeech just used "common words & phrases," not plagerized
If you don't want to look like an idiot again on Twitter, learn the proper use of the term 'Jump the Shark'
Obama lied & said  Romney caused a man's wife to get cancer & die. Delegates telling truth. Stop being beta male wuss & fight
Yes Mr Flake, federal prison. I would be for much less. You would be for much less .
she does and the American people agree. You must be a Jeb supporter.
Joe Arpaio could soon be known as $200 million man in your home district, Snow's delays saving Arpaio appeal cost
Jeff Flake has sex with under age school children...see how easy it is to make up stupid shit!!
#ourchildrenarewatching
@SabrinaSiddiqui @HillaryClinton When you say we... Oh, never mind.
what the fuck does that mean ? Jump the shark?
.@JeffFlake If Hillary Clinton doesn't deserve prison, then no one does. @ChrisChristie @realDonaldTrump
9 investigations = 0. You can't cite one statute she's violated nor cite 1 report. You have your emotions. That's it

@SabrinaSiddiqui Still a little shark-jumpy there, Skippy.
.@JeffFlake Why?She lied about need for war in Libya.She let 4 men die.She lied.She exposed our classified information & destroyed evidence.
And she is still walking around free!  We're she an American Indian her name would be Crazy-ass!!
too late Republican Party is dead @HillaryClinton
A lot of former gov't employees should not be in prison or living w/the threat, incl @Snowden & #ChelseaManning 
@JeffFlake @SabrinaSiddiqui
You think Don HillBilly can be trusted with our national security? She can't even use email legally.
You're a gossip. You can't cite one statute she's violated nor cite 1 report of 9 investigations condemning her.
The Republican Party has overreached time and time again when it comes to Bill and @HillaryClinton. You can't help yourselves.
A voice in the wilderness. Too bad you can't make them listen. But keep trying.
Thank you for being your own person rather than a #GOPlemming!
What part of Benghazi!!!!!!! do you not understand? Probably the 7 exclamation points, okay.
9 investigations & NOT 1, condemned her for any wrongdoing @ Benghazi. Cite it
GOP sanity. Thank you!
I never thought I'd say this, but I agree with you.
. You standing up for killer Hillary! Your a Democrat not a Republican! Just tell the truth! We ppl remembered!!
Your candidate is still scouring the deserts of Kenya looking for a birth certificate. Shark jumped ages ago.
#ourchildrenarewatching

Of course rs relevant. IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF MY TWEET can you even read?
Oops, I've got over 20 threads working. I assumed I was responding to an antisemite in Idaho. Accept my apology.
anyone aware of how many lawsuits there are and the millions it cost Maricopa County for Sheriff Joe
You mean, if she belongs in prison so do you, Like so many, you fear pointing the finger because your guilty too!
Jeff, your party is crazy. Like, batshit crazy.
#ourchildrenarewatching 

Clearly imagination is your strong suit.

 #trumpsunstable
I am ashamed you are representing Arizona. This won't be forgotten when your time come for re election
too late. You folks nominated a lunatic.
No, Jeff, your party can't. Shark jumping is the order of the day.
Is this how Trump & GOP intend to "Make America Great Again" .. spewing toxin, venom & fear?  DIVISIONAL!!!
The Peoples Court
sounds like someone just branded himself as a RINO
A man with 3 wives 4 bankruptcies, failed casinos and who knows what on his Tax Returns.
- anyone else who had done what she did throughout her career would be in prison already. How is your lawn?
@willfleet You obviously have never had a briefing on what your discipline will be should you mishandle classified info.
Are you joking, or are you that incredibly wimpy?
Sorry Senator -- the shark has been jumped.
One neocon defending another. I'm shocked.
#LockHerUp #Hillary4Prison2016
Careful - you might get caught being reasonable.  Seriously, thanks for trying to inject civility into this mess.
Why don't you just join their party Flake? u have done NOTHING! Now you care what happens to this corrupt witch?
GOP has abandoned and betrayed the American people. How you remain in it says nothing good about your character.
Any "flaky" RINOs who foolishly condone Hillary Clinton's utter corruption need to be voted out of office ASAP!
go join the democrat party you are not a republican
Is @JeffFlake  playing kissy kissy with @HillaryClinton ? https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/239209/ …
Let us be real...no case will ever be made against her. #SheisAboveTheLaw #wishfulthinking
2)Enough negative energy@Cleveland to cause cancer in every person attending the convention. Irrational,fearful,no vision,no plan
Sen, your party fell off the deep end. So much hate.So much negativity.No vision for the country.No policies.Just bad vibes.
Neither Clinton should ever be allowed back in the WH. Bill disgraced the office by having sex with an intern.
At what point should our LAWS be enforced, I ask ?
Preferably before  W lied us into war killing 4000 US troops. But hey, BENGHAZzomgomgbbq!!!
lol...there's an educated reply.
What’s not educated about requesting you be consistent with your law enforcing demands?
Its not jumping the shark to say people who violate the law should be in jail.
And the statute of limitations isn't up yet, Trump and still prosecute her after he wins.
