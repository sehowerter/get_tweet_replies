All due respect @BetsyDeVos you are unqualified to teach let alone lead the Dept of Ed. Step down. I'm sure he'll give you something else.
She has promoted school choice for a decade. Do you think the govt monopoly on children should continue?
last I checked, private schools are everywhere. Public schools belong to ALL Americans.
Last I checked, it was disrespectful & immoral to mandate attendance for people, espec. kids for 12 years!!
the truth is this: you want to force everyone into Christianity and set the country back 500 years.
I support voluntary attendance & freedom of religion, so you must be refering to Mrs. DeVos, yes?
The only religion religion with unfettered freedom in the US is Christianity. It's not illegal to miss school.
"Pupil may be subject to arrest under Education Code Section 48264." From "Notification of Truancy" letter @ Palo Alto HighSchool
you're unfit and unqualified. You'd be crazy to vote in Betsy.
She is bringing innovative ideas. What are you bringing?
did you even follow her confirmation hearings?
yes.
so having guns in Wyoming schools because of potential grizzlies is a novel idea we should support?
or what about getting confused about federal laws protecting students with disabilities?
did you hear her talk about proficiency vs. growth? She couldn't get a job as principal with that answer
here's the video in question
Companies that sell you a phone, a car, a house, a meal, toilet paper, & writing paper make profits too
With all respect, there are many leaders for school choice that are much more qualified. Find one of them. Peace and love.
Peace & <3 worldwide & to you now. Would you kindly name one or two of them, please?
Even though they wouldn't be my choices, I think Rhea and Jeanne Allen have more experience. Have a good evening.
ok. Thanks. Who would you choose? - Respectfully, it is easier to criticize than it is to create solutions. @RealJohnGatto is mine
Then please call your senator about @realjohngatto instead. Heck, I'll even call too. Ok...I'm out. 
Gatto is 81. It's up to you and me now. Peace sister. Respect to all people, especially kids locked in buildings.
I need your help in Silver Springs Nv.  Cowboy!

Even the dude in the middle is like "Seriously?"
School choice wants to do same thing the corps. did to mental health. Extract taxpayer money to "mega non-profits" for wealthy investors.
I wonder if she knows that she was in the heart of the most segregated schools in the city. With the lowest funding.
bragging about an academy approving you is digging yourself furthwer in the hole against anyone who went to public ed.
good luck
your the best betsey.we love the work you are doing.
Give peace a chance...and African Americans too.
We the people have faith in Betsy to get our public schools back on track. No more common core.US Civics
Civics, STEM, Arts, Music & PE, like the old days when the US was #1 in education!
is this the closest u've evr gottn to a blaq prson?
AZ supports #SchoolChoice @BetsyDeVos @TMAtalks. Wore scarf all week at my public school bringing truth & awareness #MakeEducationGreatAgain
Interesting photo. Not one minority. Make schools segregated again?
don't mess with IDEA or you're going to have a lot of angry parents.
There is no school choice just kids being bullied into working all day and night on work that makes no sense

how much did you pay them?
how much did you pay them to take this picture?? Bought & paid for is your middle name
so you took a picture with some black kids? Go teach at a public school for an entire year. Then I'll be impressed smh
If we get vouchers to enrich private school systems,can I opt out cause I want to enrich private companies?

Who did you bribe for the photo shot?
resign.
first black people you've ever talked to...

You are part of the cancer that is making the United States the laughing stock of the world. Hillbilly education for all!
If you hadn't bribed GOP senators with your $billions, you wouldn't have gotten a single vote. #PayToPlay
Step down. You are unqualified for the job.
Those are students Betsy not your staff
// no thank you..
This picture looks so staged and forced.
Congratulations on buying the SecofEdu seat. It's the American way. We know you are not qualified and children will be harmed.
why do we always use African American children to stand up next to people like this???
its a shame that youd be willing to have a neg impact on the children of America just to feed your ego
please listen to people who have years of experience in education. It's the Christian thing to do. Our future is in your hands.
hey look you finally met a person of color. Too bad your money couldnt buy you a since of patriotism and inclusiveness
this is the "take a pic with brown ppl so they think I support them" obligatory photo opp
NO< NO NO!! The American people are the majority!  We don't want Betty DeVos!  People protesting nonstop!
classic republican move. Take pics with Black students at a Black school for face points. This shit is getting old.
#schoolchoice Betsy please hire my wife Debbie. BS Second Ed,  MA Primary Ed, PHD Candidate Higher Ed Administration.
this must not be a real tweet, since you specifically stated "tweets from Betsy are signed, -Betsy". God help us.
JUST SAY NO TO BLACK MONEY BETTY !!!!
you are the worst candidate anyone can ever chose. As an educator in public schools I am fearful.
love those promotional scarves.
when was this visit scheduled ?
There's more to the job than taking pictures with children. Half of them don't look happy to be with you. QUIT NOW

WE NEED YOUR DIRECTION- DRAIN THE SCHOOL SWAMP,PLEASE
Are you afraid that if you paid Ohio the $5 million you owe the state some of it would get used for public schools?
Why don't you believe children with #autism deserve an education?
u will be approved. no charter schools, too much chance to teach islam. public schools easier to control
I saw you on an interview about Education and student loans. U have no experience at all.
Gag. You have no substance!  zero@TMAtalks


You know zip about public schools. Your money bought you position! Feel sorry for kids &teachers! Drop out!
#SchoolChoice Look who shows up @ 6:00 it's @BetsyDeVos
So...no. #swampmonster #Unqualified #notmypresident
can you provide your educational background ? Being a billionaire doesn't count
how@much did you pay those kids to smile for this photo
you're advocating against public education. Your job may be 2 manage our education system. Do you have any ethical bones in you?
WHAT ABOUT THOSE LEFT BEHIND? STOP  NOW!
You know #schoolchoice means draconian cuts 2 #publiceducation - #BetsyDeVos must NOT BE CONFIRMED! #Resistance
good job taking full advantage of a photo op with #minority students. What's next..pics with #Grizzlies You are fooling no one!

Vote No on DeVos!!
Will our vouchers allow us to choose schools that teach important historical events like the Bowling Green Massacre?


tell me about those grizzly bears again. 

guy in the middle is holding the other girl to keep her away from the wicked witch of the west, hope you can read that
See how uncomfortable she looks next to black people who aren't cleaning her house.


oh look, you got yourself a picture wth black folks. That should make up for all your crimes against them then.
.   Please just withdraw & save our kids. Your abhorrent silver spoon life won't be ruined but your inexperience could ruin many
hello
Jesus is watching how you treat the poor and disabled. You have no idea how the rest of us live. Out of touch loser!
So since you are such a fan of "school choice" are you advocating for the elimination of public schools? How will you help them?
how much were they paid to pose in this picture?
you are a total joke!!
You need to go home and stay there

oh look...random black people.  See, I'm cool.
.@BetsyDeVos @TMAtalks GUESS WHO I RELATE TO IN THIS PIC. HINT: 
@stormestone @TMAtalks -> Thank You Mrs. Devos 4 Stepping in to Help get Our Youth back on a Better Track & Brighter Future.
A Secretary of Education chosen for $200,000,000+ GOP contributions who does not BELIEVE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS is SAD!
@TMAtIalks I Iive in OR they hate school choice here. My kids went private till divorce. Then public all downhill from there
Turning kids' education into a for-profit venture requires further dismantling public sector. "See, it's not working"
UNQUALIFIED
hey betsy--I'd like to see you give a clear report of how #schoolchoice has worked out for Detroit
If public schools were a focus for all, "school choice" wouldn't need to be an option! #VoteNoDevos
You only got this nomination because of your money, not qualifications. You want to allow schools to teach creationism which isn't real.
One hopes you are carried off by winged monkeys...
pay for your own superstition and anti-science!!!#notonethindime
will fight yourappointment until I die.  #notonethindime liars,schemers,corporate coup d'etat. Google it betsy. No!


FYI Betsy some people in the pictures aren't slaves anymore..ended a few years back, Calvin may have skipped it.
Please...step down, get a job teaching at a public school, & then come back and talk to us about education!
I look forward to the Senate rejecting you. You have no business being in change of our children's education.

seriously?
DDV appointing racists and homophobes to Education Dept.  Unfit to be Sec of Education.
do you have any IDEA
flip 20% of the non-math/science teachers and replace with vo-tech teachers. Juniors can do work/school/$$ #hope

The peer effect and motivated parents make a huge difference - imagine this in their neighborhood schools...
ATTN: VERY IMPORTANT. PLEASE READ.

Billionaire standing with the poor!! You should be proud you profited off these children!!
#DumpDevos #BearsNotGuns @BetsyDeVos @TMAtalks
That guy's face in the middle tho. #noexperience #DumpDevos @BetsyDeVos
visiting a charter school, what a shock, I'm so surprised. 
beautiful photo - everybody looking at the camera for this photo would make excellent additions to @usedgov!!! #MAGA
you're not fooling anyone Mrs. DeVos

Betsy did you use spellcheck for that tweet. You're getting so good with technology. #notqualified
Hitler liked chocolate.  That means you do too!  Can we send you a case?

LOSER
I am glad to see there is some evidence that you have actually been inside of a classroom at least once.

Sen. Franken: No Democrat will vote for Betsy DeVos — and we’re seeking Republicans to oppose her https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/27/sen-franken-no-democrat-will-vote-for-betsy-devos-as-education-secretary-and-were-seeking-republicans-to-oppose-her/?utm_term=.748df76963ca …
great , please look at @KudzooApp we would like to meet with you

It must be strange, in a sea of horrifying candidates, to be the one bad enough that ppl are taking a stand #quit
yessssss! More people are calling for a no on you, than Sessions. #Quit #NoBetsyDevos #saveIDEA
choke on a scarf
you not qualified to do anything in this country but to stay home and do nothing. #dumb #unqualified #shame
We need to improve the schools we have rather than sending our kids off to different schools. It can be done.
Allah in School

Amway the ultimate #PONZI scheme, Blackwater stole tax dollars are models for DeVos' Charter Schools. #MONEYGRAB
Who is getting rich off Charter Schools?? Money is often diverted from the classroom. Many are scams/ money grabs!
fed up with your lies
Phew. Looks like you all remained unscathed from wild grizzlies! 
u r the most unqualified person for the job.  $$$$ cannot buy everything. Especially respect.
You are unqualified.
You are probably the worlds worst choice to be over anything that has to do with childrens education.
do the right thing. Just say no thank you and GO AWAY!
- #BetsyDeVos with #NOpublicschoolexperience can be next @usedgov #USEdSec. Tell Senators #NeverBetsy #DumpBetsyDeVos
People with money get to choose their childrens' schools.  Why not the poor & the rest of America?
school choice = they can reject students they don't want.  In public school, we teach #EverystudentEveryday
