#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
This is very good for you Bryan, be grateful!  This isn't the case for many Americans. Something has to give. The middle class is drowning!
And how will this awful bill help the middle class? I'm guessing you don't read to good, huh?
"You don't read to good". Learn grammar before you try to insult one who agrees with the conversation. Its ignorance like urs that drives it
Why don't you explain what you mean than? Your comment to Bryan makes zero sense, dum dum. No one can tell if you agree or not.
All you need is love, right Veronica? Pfft. Bryan understood. Keep studying. I'm not against you, I'm just not a liberal.
No love for crappy trolls, bro dude!
It's not a HC bill, it's a tax cut for the Rich. You're putting Party before Country, just so it looks like Trump has a political win.
#Shame on @SenateMajLdr
Why don't you come up with something substantive instead of ignorance!
You know that this is a disaster. The state of Louisiana does not have the resources to provide adequate healthcare to folks who need it.
Shame on you for conveniently forgetting that Hippocratic Oath you swore to uphold as you push for a bill that will literally kill Americans
Keep your promise of full repeal. #KeepThePromise #2018 #UnitedForFreedom
Please consider #FullRepeal of ACA and some common sense legislation to drive costs down. Tort Reform! Free Markets! #UnitedForFreedom!
Doing the wrong thing is worse than doing nothing... #FreeEnterprise 
#Bible #Constitution #Liberty #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #NoReplace
Say no to Trumpcare! Louisiana can't go back to where it was b4 the medicad expansion.  Please choose 1 right path during this presidency
VOTE NO!
Vote No! Secure rural hospitals
Senate bill does not pass the so-called #jimmykimmeltest Medicaid gutting hurts too many ppl
#Shame on @GOP #Shame on @BillCassidy
Capitol Police dragging a disabled protester away without his wheelchair. 
As a Louisiana citizen, I ask you to stand with @RandPaul @SenRonJohnson against Obamacare-Lite! #FullRepeal
Please please please vote against repealing the ACA. Trumpcare will hurt millions upon millions of people, please vote against repeal
Vote NO on health care bill; NO age tax; NO cuts to Medicaid or Medicare; NO caps; NO deleting essential health services. Disastrous.
Remove lifetime caps!
You really think it's smart for our federal government to provide open-ended entitlements?
For YEARS we voted for the #FullRepeal Repubs promised. Instead they give us Obamacare II. BETRAYAL! #UnitedForFreedom
Vote NO against this enrichment of the wealthy. Save University Health and our med schools. Without Medicaid, they can't survive.
#Shame on you
#Shame on @SenateGOP
Capitol Police: 43 protesters arrested as disability rights activists conducted a "die-in" to block hallway near Sen. McConnell's office. 
Vote against this proposed bill, show Louisiana you care about health care for the elderly and disadvantaged of the state you represent.
Senator Collins is voting no now that she had seen the score. Join her bravery to put the care of people over tax cuts.  We need you sir.
We want #FullRepeal
NO trumpcare or Obamacare! #REPEALObamacare completely as PROMISED! UnitedforFreedom!
Are you supporting it? Why/why not?
Senator, hope u vote yr conscience & the good of yr constituents and vote NO on #AHCA! #NoCutsToMedicaid just for tax cuts for 1% & .1%!
500,000 veterans would lose their insurance, if the Senate TrumpCare bill is passed. I know you care about our veterans! Vote NO!
@SenateMajLdr is a punk.
#shame
Huge protest inside and outside of Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mcconnell's office happening right now. 
#Shame
Protesters with disabilities stage a "die-in" over cuts to Medicaid outside of Sen. Mitch McConnell's office. 

Healthcare Protesters are arrested outside Sen. McConnell's office on Capitol Hill after the release of the #SenateGOP Healthcare Bill. 
Pls do something in LA regarding animal welfare. Another case popped up today. U have a poor reputation on this issue #Justice4DrDrip
Healthcare is a commodity--
Free market creates competition and organically brings down cost. 
#FulRepeal
#UnitedForFreedom
Louisiana and other states rely on Medicaid. I hope President Trump listens to you. The #HealthcareBill, as written, is a very terrible bill

Be a healthcare hero for your state! #cassidyvoteno
I thank you kindly for your time and attention to this matter, if you had the chance to read this or not.Thank you for your consideration/13
Senator, please vote NO on the Senate "healthcare" bill. Because it is not healthcare, Sir. It's a death sentence for my husband. /12
Sen.Cassidy, I implore you to consider the poorest &sickest Americans that depend on this care.i implore you to remember us when you vote/11
But Sir, you never know when a tragedy will devastate your family.& if you live paycheck to paycheck,you will not survive the devastation/10
How's that retreat with the Koch brothers going this weekend? Have they convinced you to murder millions of Americans yet?
If we lose the ACA, my husband will not get the care he needs. I know this is not your problem. I can understand & respect that. /9
I don't how anyone who votes yes to this disgusting bill could look at themselves in the mirror - or their children - ever again!
I pay my taxes, Sir. I don't get any aid from our government. I work. Hard. But my husband needs me home. And we have no assets. /8
I've lived here my entire life. I've worked my entire life. I never thought I could lose everything.But I did.Medical bills are crippling./7
I working part time now.We are staying with family now til we get back on our feet.But I will lose my job this month -my office was sold./6
If it weren't for the ACA, he wouldn't be walking today & Talking today.Still his memory is gone & still he requires extensive treatment. /5
I had to quit my job to stay home and take care of the man I love. After his stroke he was paralyzed & lost his memory & speech for years./4
If not for the ACA, my husband would be dead, after suffering an ischemic stroke 4 years ago. We lost our home to pay hospital bills. /3
Sir, this bill will mean the absolute destruction of my family. We lost everything after my husbands stroke. If it weren't for ACA, /2
Senator Cassidy, I'm sorry to bother you, but I must request your promise to vote NO on the Senate healthcare bill. It's a death sentence./1
Are you selling out your oath and legacy to give @POTUS his first win in office? He would not return the favor. He won't be around long.
Concerns? You have concerns but might vote yes? HATE this garbage about concerns then voting for  death. Stand up. Be decent & right.
Are you taking money from Russia? The lack of logic and callousness evinced today re: regarding Medicare suggests OTHER influences. #Breaux
Senator Cassidy please vote NO on Senate healthcare bill.
To see a doctor voting yes on this bill would be a true paradox. Isn't the whole point of becoming a doctor to save, and not kill, lives?
Ouch.
Save your patients. Save the children. Save the elderly. Save the youth. #SaveACA
#NoAHCA
Vote no on this bill. It will be devistating for our state. Now is the time to stand up for US. Don't take away our essential protections.
The Senate #TrumpDontCare bill is straight out of Dickens. Steals Tiny Tim's crutches and insurance to slash taxes for Scrooge.
Please show that you have a heart for all your constituents, rich AND poor. Vote NO! on health care bill.
We are praying you don't support this #legislation
dear sir, please do the right thing. vote against this bill, work to make one that works for all. we need accessible, affordable health care

Please vote no. Millions of Americans will suffer, many will die. You can save them with this vote. #VoteNo #AHCAKills
Please vote no on this terrible bill that will hurt so many of your most vulnerable constituents.
Please vote no to the new health care bill.
This bill is not a health care bill- it is a tax relief bill for the top 5 percent? do u really need that 3.8 % cut more than the poor do?
Do U , your fellow GOPers really need that 3.8 % tax cut so much that u r willing to seriously harm so many of your constituents?
Why can u not admit that only flexibility u r giving to governors is they get to decide WHICH of their constituents they get to screw over
How can u take 88 B out of Medicaid and not destroy Medicaid? 2/3 of people in nursing homes, 1/2 of all babies born covered under Medicaid
Please vote NO and represent the interests of the people who live in our state - not the 2%!
Do no harm.
Please don't support this bill in its current form. It does non of what was promised before election. Take your time and get it RIGHT PLEASE
You will eventually vote to make life that much harder for the most vulnerable of this state.
Please leave "your love of God" out of your campaign ads. It's manipulation and untrue. To love him is to care for his people.
With all due respect to the man, he looks just like an EAGLE-turned-human to me...
The suspense is killing me! Not really. I know you'll vote for the Mean and Heartless Healthcare bill in the end.
Do the right thing for the people of your state and this country. We were moving in the right direction w/ACA. Work to IMPROVE it!! #NoAHCA
Please put Louisiana first. Do not vote for this bill which will hurt so many Louisianians.
Video made for my Senator who won't hold a town hall but you can answer me as well. https://youtu.be/QP892uyzl70  Vote No. Be a human being.
There’s no way to tweak the bill to not hurt LA. It ends Medicaid expansion, which will kick 428,000 Louisianans off coverage. Period!
Shame on u. Face it. Tens of thousands die and hundreds of thousands in La lose coverage. How can that be fixed with this bill? Vote no!
Before you vote, shouldn't you be able to cite specifics re: the dramatic premium increases for 60+ year olds (i.e. This example from AK)
This is a terrible bill.  It will hurt so many.  Please vote no.  Please.
Vote no. You told us in Breaux Bridge that Medicaid is good for Louisiana. It's on film.
What...it doesn't take away enough?
Vote for this bill and the people of LA will send you packing next election.
Please don't cave to ins. and the rich, vote no on this AHCA. It's a life or death situation.
Now is your chance to choose your state over your party. Do the right thing. #VoteNo
Be sure to watch Dollar Bill Cassidy sell his poor constituents down the river while grinning freakishly. He's a corporate shill not an MD.
#truth
Thanks for calling for more time on important legislation.Hearings from stakeholders are a must.
How do lifetime caps pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?
They do not
@BillCassidy please don't pass this criminal #Wealthcarebill.. We shouldn't be giving top 2%ers 500 billion at the expense of poors health!
As a physician, fellow Louisianian, and hopefully a decent man, please vote no for this abomination!
Just watched. Seems like you're all more concerned with $ rather than people's actual well being. Please vote no. #AHCAisIMMORAL
I think you are a good advocate and an honest broker. I wish you were advocating for fixing Obamacare rather than this AHCA.
Please vote no! It is an awful bill that will harm millions, including many of ur constituents! Country Before Party!
So the real question does the bill pass the @jimmykimmel test?
And you know that LA residents will be harmed by giving more power to states.
If you give that much money back to the wealthy doesn't that cause Medicaid to be unsustainable?
How do you justify lifetime caps?
Ask him about lifetime caps?!!
How on Earth do you think people will get private insurance when they lose Medicaid? They're on Medicaid, that means they're poor!
@PatToomey my PA Senator lying his ass off on @FaceTheNation pushing this#wealthcare bill. Knowing PA poor can't afford HC without medicaid.
Face your constituents>Face the Nation
How are they going to move off? How?
Sir, the AMA and AGA--your professional peers--condemn the AHCA. How can you possibly vote for it?
#BillCassidy, #Please #VoteNo ONTHE #Republican #GOP #Healthcare #Trumpcare Bill! Please Vote #No To #Represent #Louisiana And #America 
You and Toomey are disgraces.
Vote No to the Republican death are bill

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
I will not

Also interesting to watch today: Obama presser from June 23 2009, as he took 30 min of questions on his health plan. 
@jtbcummins check out my thread that refutes your criteria.
LOWER PREMIUMS? Pt 1: Per Kaiser Foundation: a 60 year old making $43k (351% of FPL) in #NOLA has a premium of $15k, 34% of annual income! + 
Would like a response to this thread from @BillCassidy office asap. 
We are your constituents and our lives are on the line

150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
