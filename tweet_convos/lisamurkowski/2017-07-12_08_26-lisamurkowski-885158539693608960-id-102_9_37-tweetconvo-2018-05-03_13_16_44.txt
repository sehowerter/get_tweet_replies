This looks like a possible sell-out for #BCRA. Please don't. We depend on #ACA for coverage. Fix the system, don't destroy it
Please don't sellout! Be a hero and save Americans' healthcare!
If Trumpnocare passes, republicans will be known as baby and children killers. I left Republican party cuz so many like Cruz. Stand up 4 us
Don't let McConnell buy you! Stay strong and vote NO on BCRA. America needs your No vote.
Don't pass the Senate healthcare bill
#savemedicaid #voteno
Don't, just don't.

Republicans use state payoffs to win votes for repeal bill http://politi.co/2t0C42V  
Vote to protect Americans with disabilities, vote against cuts to Medicaid!
How about some "true" examples of how that would work? Your constituents will not appreciate you selling their health away. #HealthcareFraud
Do not demean yourself and your state by taking hc pork.
Please vote NO on the healthcare bill. Protect all of your constituents & all Americans! Thanks!
You are now complicit in #GOP bribe to steal healthcare from millions. #polarpayoff
Enough is enough. You people promised to repeal. You have the Executive, Legislature and Judicial branch now. TIMES UP. GET IT DONE
BREAKING: The insurance industry says Cruz amendment is a killer for those w/ pre-existing conditions. #NoBCRA #ProtectOurCare
Polar Payout, eh?  23 mil lose lifeline but you got yours.  NO conviction..No morals...just another R for tax break for rich.
Ppl of AK, your Senator just sold you out, this is a bold face lie & your health care costs will rise. A billion$ in fed funds=Selling Price
Trumpcare is still a disaster,Vote NO..The long term damage it would do is a horror for the sick and elderly.
Vote no on Trumpcare. #Resist McConnell and the GOP. Force them to include the dems at the table #PleaseDontTakeOurHealthcare
Please stand strong and vote NO on the latest incarnation of Trumpcare. Remember, we are the UNITED States of America. And we are afraid.
So you sold your vote is what I am hearing.
You do know insurance companies just dissed the bill? But, I guess you're finished with your Senate gig so you don't care!
Senator, the ppl of Alaska and the entire  country implore you to oppose this awful bill. People will die or go bankrupt. Fix the ACA.
Life long Alaskans premiums WE paid WERE $900 a month now over $3,000 per month! Never been on any public assistance we've always paid taxes
We don't pay state income taxes, but many are too sick to work or are working & get sick. The hype about "moochers" is just that - hype.
Bull crap, I KNOW a woman who lives in a $850,000 they built who doesn't want work, just had her 4th child. Applied and GOT Medicaid! FACT
And Trump has a "friend" named Jim (who also doesn't really exist).
Say what you like but I'm not a liar. When you know the facts maybe you'll change your mind.
2/2 you wanted an open process.  I call BS.  I am a Alaskan who wrote your name in and you make me sorry I did!
1/2  Bottom line is that as a Republican you have a mandate from the voters. Repeal the ACA!  You failed in that mandate because you said
Wear some makeup or at least put a bag over your face.
Vote no, fix ACA with reasonable, intelligent, bipartisan discussion. #womenleaders
That's great...doesn't mean you should approve trumpcare.
Govt price controls and other market interference=bad consequences.
AK: PP=2, Comm Health Ctrs=165, more services, whole family.
OPEN DEBATE
Be a shining example to all-cross the aisle and get with Dems to fix the ACA. You know it's the right thing to do. We will not forget.
revision/repeal of ACA w/o democrats at the table is wrong and you know it. Admin does not have a mandate. #dotherightthing
And how bad is #Trumpcare? Murkowski helped to ensure that she and her colleagues wont have to suffer with it

They get to keep ACA
1332 waiver allows junk insurance to be sold with bare coverage after Murkowski helps repeal ACA

No pre-existing protections
1332 is an insurance pool that HURTS even MORE Alaskans!
Why do you hate Alaskans so much? Still angry we voted your father out?
I have called office TEN TIMES over past 6 weeks
Your office STILL will not return my calls
I even wrote your name in 2010 - HUGE mistake
Please vote no on this bill.  The ACA needs to be fixed by the whole senate.  How you vote effects the whole country.
41% of Americans approve of Obamacare
Only 16% approve of TrumpCare
Please vote no! 
We do not want ACA repealed. 
We want it fixed!
Like...
Please vote NO on this abomination! Fix what exists and abandon the repeal folly. #VoteNoBCRA
Vote NO on this horrendous so called "health care" bill!
Don't make us lose our progress. Not dying is progress! Vote NO and keep the ACA! Alaskans will die if you don't!
I guess now you have a reason to vote for the new Trump care
Thanks for nothing
Here in Homer AK. My mother passed a couple yrs ago,w/o the ACA things would have been so awful for us. Bankruptcy.
Please continue to say No to Medicaid cuts.  Americans  need you to hold your ground.  Please don't cave!  Thank you!
You will say no to the disasterous health care bill?
Amazing people will tell you not to vote for a bill that's not even written yet. And just think these idiots vote
Stay strong on National health care. Hold out for bipartisan and open process with hearings and experts. Don't get bullied by Mitch.
Absolutely not good enough. Vote no, it's the moral choice. Real people will be hurt if you vote yes. You know the numbers, choose correctly
Ditch the dogma and get a heart. Sensible healthcare reform requires thought. Country before party. NO: #Trumpcare #misery #suffering #BCRA
Vote yes on new health care bill
It's great the state is working on solutions but trumpcare bill is not the way forward. Please vote no and then repair ACA issues instead.
@GOP senators attend townhalls & allow voters to BEG literally BEG YOU for the lives of their loved ones;  it's shameful.  How dare you?
I hope you are not leaning on voting for the dumpster fire of a bill #saveourcare
NO on trumpcare! How much clearer can we be?
Senator Murkowski I believe you probably entered politics because you believe in integrity & accountability. Support it, #IMPEACHMENTNOW
Over 50% of credit report debt is med bills. This new plan will set us back to when cheap plans did nothing and bills crippled people.
PLEASE don't sell us out for some token gift in this awful bill. Cruz/Lee are moving this bill to the right (worse). We'll go back 15 years.

#REPEAL and stay out of healthcare.  It was a failure with Dems and will be a failure again.
Therefore no ACA "repeal", then? Thus no more wasting time replacing ACA, work to improve ACA, incr lwr-cost access not hi-cost "coverage".
@lisamurkowski BCRA is not the answer and would harm many Alaskans. Vote no on Trumpcare and work to improve ACA.
You know the #BRCA is awful. Put constituents & country over partisan politics and VOTE NO. This is about OUR LIVES. #HealthCare #ACA
#NoBCRA Older Alaskans get the worst deal in the US.
Please PLEASE vote no on this horrible "health care" bill.
Oh my word, please don't sell out. Please stay strong and vote no on Trumpcare.
Unbelievable.
You have got to be kidding me.

And more abortions? Yay!
Outstanding! Now please convince your colleagues this is the sort of plan the rest of the country needs. #SaveOurCare #fixnotreplace
Please vote NO on the healthcare plan. Take time to do it right! Maybe the effort should be on lowering costs?
No longer can afford health insurance! Stop the abuse of Medicaid! Stop rewarding bad behavior and rewarding people who refuse to work! 
Please please repeal ACA and replace with something ALL Alaskans can afford. I'm a TAX PAYER and can't afford $3,200 a month premiums!
For everyone, like the self employed? Where can I read about this?
Vote NO on #bcra it's a bad deal for AK + US. The ACA has provided countless benefits to AK and could allow for so much more w/ more support
Please vote no @lisamurkowski! Your constituents depend on it.
This is the trinket that Senator Murkowski will get in exchange for voting for Trumpcare, which will devastate here state.
No trumpcare! The ACA is not as horrible as you are pushing, but it could use support and improvements. #VoteNoBCRA 99507
Sounds like the senator is a big fold on Trumpcare. Going to sell her constituents down the river.
This waiver is available because of ACA NOT Trumpcare. It does not address the 62,000 AKs losing healthcare if you vote yes. Vote NO on TC!
And this twitter campaign against Alaskans is sickening
Please don't sell out Alaska by supporting ACA repeal in exchange for a #BridgeToNoCclare
Repeal Obamacare now
What do you like about #Trumpcare @ptmarigan? Be specific.
