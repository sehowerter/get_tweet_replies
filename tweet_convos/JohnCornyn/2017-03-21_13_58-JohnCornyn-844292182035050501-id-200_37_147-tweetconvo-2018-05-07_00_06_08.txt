Great. Did we not need nine a year ago? #YeahEveryoneThinksTheSCShouldHaveNine
, your beloved Hillary was and remains apart of different investigations....
OK. What does she have to do with anything in this thread?  She's always brought up to deflect
, simple, she has a shady history, needs to be investigated by an independent prosecutor
That's what many people think. But still not relevant to this thread. So you saying Trump's OK?
, well Rick, all I can say it is relevant to me, we r both old enough to now the Clintons
There's a lot out there for Clintons and Trump. Some exaggerated and some not. Investigators
Everywhere. No charges for Clinton. Who knows why?  We will see about Trump. I think he's in it
It would have been really impressive if Merrick Garland had been given a hearing. Party over People. Shame on you.
Was he equal to Merrick Garland? Oh wait you wouldn't even give him a hearing or time of day,You HYPOCRITE! Shame.
that's cause you're a #partisanhack Party before country is all the comes out of ur mouth these days #boybye #resist #wehaveeyes
yeah, you would be. #canCornyn2020
I sincerely hope that you are joking.
apparently we didn't need nine last year, though... #MerrickGarland
He's Russia's choice!
#WeNeedNine !!!? U R Guinness Record holder of obstruction. At least Gorsuch gets a HEARING! U denied USA from hearing Garland..
So what? Garland wasn't getting on if Hillary won.
Senate shouldn't continue with nomination of Gorsuch during FBI’s investigation.Trump's legitimacy is in question!
We needed nine for like a year now. What happened to Merrick Garland...??
Y should women b subject to the sexist rulings of a judge picked by a traitor.  If we need 9, you should have confirmed Garland.
#noonebutmerrickgarland @HardballChris
RESIST
of course u were light weight questions!!
#WeNeedNine Is this a joke? Eight was fine when #MerrickGarland was nominated...
You know, you might have been impressed with Merrick Garland, too...if you'd given him a hearing.
someone under investigation should not be leading our country. U must pause this hearing. Do ur duty. Country 1st.
We need a justice that is not nominated by a so-called president who is under a cloud of suspicion.
you and Cruz are a trip.
NOT impressive he believed trucker should freeze or handicapped children go without help. NO HEART LIKE YOU
Esp for the empathy he expressed towards the people he screwed over in favor of corporations.
#ifweneedninenowweneedednineayearago
so why didn't you even give the previous nominee a chance?
Must be thrilled about his unanimous overturn by SCOTUS. #OOPSIE
We needed 9 when Merrick Garland was nominated.
... It'll do when POTUS is under investigation for colluding with Putin.
we haven't needed 9 for quite some time. Remember.
SAD. You MUST know of your own hypocrisy. I wonder what it is like to have no conscience?
where was #WeNeedNine when Republicans wouldn't even give Merritt Garland a hearing? #EightWasEnough then, right? #Hypocrite
Unfortunately he didn't answer all questions well or at all. Sidestepped.
Shocking? He hit that turd right out of the park, did he?
You are truly an abomination to tweet crap like this. Seriously. #TexasShame #MerrickGarland
As long as 45 is under FBI investigation, this should NOT continue. He may be a TRAITOR. Better tread carefully.
Of course you are, sir. Bless your heart.
since you are so closed minded that is no wonder you were impressed, pathetic unAmerican you are
It is Judge Garland's stolen seat
This is my surprised face.
gorsuch is pro corp and not with the American worker...check out his record
#WeNeedNine Could have nine a year ago if you had done your job.
we needed 9 justices when Garland was nominated...
you could have had nine a year ago, so I don't know about this current "need"
If it is so pressing to have 9, why waste an entire year to block Garland?  #hypocrite
More like a GOP circle jerk. #Resist #TexasSenators #LastTerm
the guy that ruled against a man who almost froze to death. No thanks Cornyn.
Take #WeNeedNine hypocrisy somewhere else.
Of course you were.
I was impressed too. You still did Merrick Garland wrong and we won't forget that. @JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts
you were fine with 8 for over a year, and now with news of POTUS under investigation? No, just no. #hypocrisy
.@JohnCornyn how do you sleep at night in your seething cloak of hypocrisy?
.@JohnCornyn how, I wonder, would you feel if the shoe were on the other foot? #hypocrisy #kickcornyntothecurb
we needed nine a year ago. You've now set a precedent that no SCOTUS seat will get filled in the last year of a Pres. term
all the "Garland criers" need to remember that then-Senator Biden supported that precedent years ago.  #needahanky
You are easily impressed, I see.
#WeNeededNineAYearAgo   #notgettingoverit
illegitimate nomination from an illegitimate president. Republicans reach new low daily
Objection: Merrick Garland.
impressed by astute answers to your & others thoughtful questions. Amazed at his patience answering some Dem's Q's
8 didn't bother you until now. You are a hypocrite. NO to Gorsuch. #DOYOURJOB #YOUWORKFORUS Town hall 75831
Garbage. Softballs. Not 1 meaningful question. You guys are BSing about basketball instead of doing your jobs.  #rubberstamp
so what's his favorite color ?
I was able to watch some of it. Impressed as well.  Even If I am just a Person - that goes to Rodeo's. :)
@RubenV4U @GorsuchFacts It's sad that fewer n fewer people care bout what politicians say anymore. Honor n truth where art thou?
Agreed. If public servants speak with "honor and truth" they will be heard.
Ruben I hope u run for office again ur a good man.
Thank you and much appreciated.
#weneednine? #onlywhenitsuitsus #hypocrite
, color me surprised.  The same dark money supports you both...
zero credibility. Racist and bigot values. A fake Christian.
you're just a complicit coward. An embarrassment to your state and family.
your handlers specifically told you that this would cause a constitutional crisis. You stood silent. Now ......
we want #merrickgarland #stolenscotus
: Only because your a Softball pitcher.
we needed nine a year ago
: Only because your a GOP'ite.
agree
Rings hallow when you didn't give Garland a hearing.
you are such a fraud and phony. I'm sure he had those questions way early and could prepare.
record & career shows he's pro corporate &he sides with the powerful few over ordinary Americans
Yes, but what about the investigation regarding collusion with Russia?  That should settled be first!
you don't get to #weneednine when you blatantly ignored all my questions about the incomplete court in 2016
8 was good enough for a year. Wait until 45 who nominated him isn't under FBI investigation.  Fair is Fair!
You would be impressed with any Republican. Too bad Merrick Garland never got a hearing.
#2020
Here we go. You're gonna need more staffers for the phones. Totally inappropriate to take Garland's seat. Cowards.
Of course you are...  all in for big corporations and on the down low for contributions to Senators.
@realDonaldTrump campaign is under FBI investigation. This nominee is damaged goods, just like prez. #russiagate
Johnny is a partisan joke. I cannot wait for his retirement in 2020
What about 9, 9 months ago? Your bombastic arrogance will be remembered when I got to the voting booth.
.@JohnCornyn No lifetime appointments until investigation into Trump's ties with Russia are completed. We will hold you accountable #Shame
Yes, let's vote him out!
if #weneed9 was so critical, where were you a year ago? #8willdo
you had 11 months to get to 9. The man who appointed Gorsuch is under investigation by the FBI! Wait 4 the result
Good for you, but he dodged questions about his views on same-sex marriage. Sounds fishy to me.
how can you carry on with business as usual?  This hearing should be postponed.  Illegit POTUS = illegit nom
If I tell you I agree with you, will you reciprocate and do me a flava? #TrumpTaxes
no vote no seat until #RussiaGate is concluded
Yes, no vote until everything is clear.
Been doing alright with 8 for a while. Let's wait for the investigation before you do anything. Ok comrade?
where was WeNeedNine last year?
Of course you would. That "screw poor Americans" attitude.  No rights unless you're a rich white male!!
#WeNeedNineButOnlyHadEight #BecauseOfRepublicanHostilityAndHypocrisy
isn't your actual motto "#WeNeedNine unless it's a Democratic president nominating"?
You missed the tiny asterisk at the end of the hashtag. Oh, wait. It's hiding behind the "e" in "nine". 
@JohnCornyn you fed him such softball questions that you should be ashamed of wasting the time of the rest of Senators.
I'm most offended by your "we need nine" hashtag. You're aware of the irony, right?
should we be making lifetime appointments when the person appointing is under investigation by the FBI?
I hope he didn't use too many big words for you, like "constitutional."
What about the other questioning? Did you pay attention to any of it?
No, just no. All the Republicans defending Trump are under a huge cloud of suspicion. #Trumprussia
this whole hearing is a sham and you have a part in it
We've been trying to get answers from you.
Nomination not appropriate while @POTUS under federal investigation concerning ties with Russian intelligence
bet u r after u refuse Pres Obama the opportunity.
#WeNeededNineIn2016
#WeNeedNine about a year ago!
You are one of my senators. I was NOT impressed with Judge Gorsuch. We have found a way around nine. #eightwilldo
Let's vote him out! Do not support health care repeal, millions will lose coverage.
we need 9?  Really?  We needed 9 a year ago. Don't even act like that means something!
And who cares what you think. You've lost all credibility. Hypocrite. #TrumpRussiaCollusion #investigatetrump
He's not a friend to women. And Trump is being investigated. Hold your horses on this one.
@CNN @MSNBC Rs have praised,disregarded flaws of every single 1 of DT Nominees.Ppl watching aren't buying it.
No confirmation on lifetime appointments until POTUS criminal investigation has concluded. Period. #Trumprussia
Did you just hashtag We Need Nine?  Are you kidding me?
Senator, you shirked your duty last year by not holding confirmation hearings for Garland, and now We Need Nine?
Let's vote him out. He's a politician.
why do you suddenly need 9? You didn't need nine a few months ago.
I'm wondering if you want ALL religions crammed down our throats or just YOUR religion?
As your constituent, I do NOT support Gorsuch hearings until we have answers on #Trumprussia
#WeNeeded*Nine Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. Would you have continued to stall Garland if your boy had lost?
If we needed 9 so bad, it should have been done months ago
I can't believe you would use that hashtag when you obstructed govt by refusing to hear Merick.
I cannot wait to vote you out of office #2020.
Yes, let's get him out! @CNN @FoxNews
We needed nine last year and you failed to do your job, you failed to do the right thing pandering to racist
There should be no SCOTUS hearings until we get to the bottom of Russia's interference in our election.
, really enjoyed watching Gorsuch today, he appears to have a lot of integrity. Garland would have been bad 4 2nd
And I'm appalled at the hypocrisy and lack of ethics from @GOP. The president's  legitimacy is in question.
can't wait to vote you out. #hypocrite #MerrickGarland #CountryOverParty
The sheer audacity & arrogance of your #weneednine is disgusting. Yes we do & have for over a year no thanks to u
We needed Nine, since Scalia died.. Where was your enthusiasm THEN??
what happened to change your mind . I recall that Cruz and you had no problem last year with eight.
why don't you have #TownHall and tell us how impressed you were? #whatareyouafraidof #hypocrite
All he did was skirt around the issues The whole GOP acted like they were in love with him really
of course you were.. blinded by misguided party loyalty and money as you are
oh, now you need 9? Sorry, bud. Not under these circumstances. #hypocrite #whereiscornyn
oh, NOW we need 9.. not when Obama had his own Judge. #Hypocrite #voteyouout
The American people are not judge of such as @JohnCornyn. May his Final Judge show mercy on this disingenuous kind of evil.
Was he better or worse than Merrick Garland? Oh.. right.. you didn't ask him any questions.
I can't believe you're tweeting #weneednine. This is nonsense. I like gorsuch but nothing says we need nine.
@GorsuchFact Impressed as well. Your questions, however, inexcusable given what is at stake for your constituents
funny how we didn't need nine nine months ago.
are you really going to hashtag this #WeNeedNine after what you pulled with Garland? Really?
SMH
I would be impressed if you announced your retirement. #TermLimits
I was not impressed by his attitude re: the $10MIL dollar dark $ pushing his confirmation. #SCOTUS not for sale.
we needed 9. congress balked & refused to vet garland. how can we trust the judgement of a man (trump) so corrupt?
Me too!
You impress easily.
2. I plan on making sure I vote out not only my senators, but also @PeteSessions! Vote in 2018 & 2020! #resist
is party to "One-Term President" & No Year Four Confirmation. Ethics were called into question & found wanting.
been happy with answers too, but if #WeNeedNine why didn't you support confirmation of the previous nominee?
Were you impressed how Garland answered as well? O wait you are a massive partisan hack with no respect for Const.
This confirmation needs to wait until investigation into the current administrations' ties with Russia complete.
@GorsuchFacts
Wow - the #snowflakes and resistance whiners follow your account as well.  Sorry about that.  Stay strong. #MAGA
We needed nine when Garland was nominated too, but you didn’t care about it then. Why? @GorsuchFacts
We needed 9 last year. #votehimout #hypocrisy
.@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Then you weren't paying very much attention
no confirmation while White House is under FBI investigation.
@POTUS is under investigation by FBI for colluding w a foreign adversary @JohnCornyn  No #Gorsuch No #SCOTUS nomination
what make you think ANY #SCOTUS nominationbis ok under these circumstances?
Constituents DO NOT support this, @JohnCornyn How many times do we have to tell you?
I like him too.  But, we needed 9 last year too!
More impressed than with Merrick Garlands?
I expected nothing less than a love fest between you two. #politics #hypocrisy #partisan #MerrickGarland
Reply to @JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts #WeNeedNine? Really? Dont get me wrong he is a fine selection, but saying we need nine is laughable.
Soft ball questions get soft ball answers...good for you!
Merrick Garland would have answered your questions had you let him. Shame on you for stealing this seat.
of course you were. 1, there shouldnt be a vacancy. 2, Trump is being investigated by the FBI= no SCOTUS pick
Yes, no vote!
We needed 9 last year. Why only now? Not disputing he's been impressive. GOP played politics, no moral highground
Funny how all of a sudden you "need" 9.
Really? #WeNeedNine but y'all refused to even have hearings for #MerrickGarland??? Can you just stop with the #hypocrisy
#NoSCOTUS until y'all #InvestigatePOTUS
WE *NEEDED NINE
I'm impressed by how "artificial" his manner is... and his skating around very important questions.
I'm also impressed by his use of the words "administrative state." That's straight-up Bannon talk.
yep
we are not fooled. B/c we are not fools.
And yet we didn’t need nine when Garland was the nominee? Hypocrite.
