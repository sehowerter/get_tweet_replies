You are worried about Dems when you should worry about what your constituents want.  No to DeVos. #wearewatching
you are in real danger of losing reelection. Listen to your constituents.
there as many who like what he is doing as those that dont
DeVos in charge educating our kids only bc she has scAmway $billions. You like that?
so I guess you are against Christian schools and other schools she is not doing away with public school
http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2017/01/30/devos-nomination-senate-vote/97243810/ … Hey Gail check out this article from MI where DeVos lives.

it's probably because at one point I sent her a Whitney Houston gif.
And I thought we are all getting so close 
hi senator, have you had a chance to review your constituents requests about Betsy DeVos yet? Please vote no.
he voted yes. He does not work for us.
Guess I'm hoping for an excellent liberal candidate next election so I can swipe left on Sen Cornyn. @LaurenCMedelLaw @JohnCornyn
I  am too. Honestly I'd be ok with a moderate who actually works for her constituents. That'd work too.
What wasn't prudent was your behavior and disrespect of President Obama.  It was his seat to fill...where is your integrity?
The GOP stupidly thinks voter base approves of appeasing mentally impaired fascist POTUS & unamerican cabinet.
Republicans in real danger of destroying the democracy thousands have died to protect.
scared John.... maybe Texas will replace you next year,  you sure don't represent me well
Your political pettiness is growing tiresome. Do your job.
um how?  The democrats have bigger balls and longer linghams than Texas syncophants
Republicans are in real danger of violating our Constitution.  But apparently that is the new party line.
And you didn't overplay your hand when it came to Merrick Garland. Hypocrite!
Mitch and the GOP STOLE the nomination!  #PartyofThieves
Quit playing politics and Pay Attention to Your Constituents!  Please.
.@JohnCornyn , you're in danger of playing yourself out of office. Vote NO on Betsy DeVos. #houstonresists #teachersagainstdevos
Weve threatened Cornyn for years yet hes still there. However DeVos is a good pick. Yes 4 school choice.
@EduCommotion @JohnCornyn
School choice = school chooses students not parents  choosing school. No on DeVos.
Nooo.... Parents choose the school. Yes for DeVos.
@dhfessler @EduCommotion @JohnCornyn
and YOU are in great danger of losing your seat. The crybabies and pussies are in the streets speaking to you.
#TXConstituents want a #NoDeVos vote. You ignore those u represent. Any1 backing Trump backs racism. #UnAmerican
ur constituents will not forget in 18.
Republicans are at risk of destroying education in America...
Please vote against Betsy DeVos. She has shown a clear lack of knowledge on the most basic educational concepts.
postcard avalanche is coming, senator. Texas won't stay red when you refuse to hear moderate constituents
a thinly veiled threat to ram thru wholly unqualified and immoral candidates? Or  more self interests?
If this is true, why are you the one hiding from your constituents?
And you're in real danger of not being reelected. Thanks for abandoning your constituents. We're paying attention now ;) #resist
- I seem to remember that a few months ago, the Republicans were perfectly happy to fight a legitimate SCOTUS nominee.
No one has overplayed their hand more than the Repubs during Obama's two terms.
This is NOT a game. Your vote impacts people's lives. You swore to serve Texans. You lied. #DumpDevos
Sir, we are just getting started, oh, and you have a target on your back!  Raise as much $ as you want!
Republicans set the standard in Congress for the past 6 years.Of course Cornyn ignores that.
Why do you only care about Dem strategy?  How about repairing ACA and voting against devos?
Hypocrisy alert!
it's not a poker game John!
And Republicans are in danger of showing their constituents they're a bunch of cowards and won't stand up to Trump.
trump needs to show his taxes.   republicans will have no credibility during next election
you know nothing about Dems or your constituency ---voting 100% w trump is a bad strategy morally and electorally
hard to do when @realDonaldTrump makes it too easy a target
Yep.  That's all this is is a poker game to you.
you scared, bro?
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi R's overplayed their hand 8yrs.D's are listening to voices of Constituents,are you?
Stay the course. Go nuclear if you must.
Senator, you should be standing with Dems on DeVos. She is more unqualified that trump!
Senator, your constituents are asking you to vote NO on DeVos. Is this the hill you want to die on?
as opposed to, say, Greg Abbott, defunding Veterans Courts and threatening to arrest elected officials?
Blocking hearings for Obama's pick created a lot of ill will with your constituents.  Start listening.
republicans are awash in hubris. Merrick Garland is a better candidate you gave no consideration. It's called Karma
The people are more verbal than ever! We the people don't have to take what Trump and his goonies shove at us
none of his nominees are deemed acceptable for the seats. U will see Dems will increase their momentum and
Texas voters put u in office, I suggest u realize that a majority of the US do not like DeVOS .No shoukd b voted
YR views makes all of us realize that u Don't into consideration of what the people of the US want, selfish
VOTE No on Devos or we will vote you out! You represent us! Do your job VOTE NO!
Not governing, being obstructionist about everything worked for your party didnt it?
very good article but we hope you don't weaken senator. We expect you get our judge confirmed period. Do it.
we are watching your every move John. Don't capitulate now. You are off to a good start with #POTUS rock on
Youre in real danger of angering your electorate. "Come to DC" is not the correct response when constituents ask to meet w/ you
You make time for donors, so please make time to hold town hall meetings in TX @TX10Indivisible @DTX_Indivisible @indivisibleHOU
I vote in every single Republican primary in Texas. You will be primaried. You represent all Texans. Not just Rs
Vote NO on DeVos.
... i'm one of your constituents. Please vote no on Betsy
I think the Republicans are overplaying their hand. I think the next election will show....
Some of your Republican constituents are very, very disappointed with the direction of the party.  Think carefully on that.
you do so much concern trolling of Ds you forget you're the one boosting Russia and stripping health insurance
Since you won't clear out your voicemail so ppl can call you----TEXAS VOTES NO ON DEVOS!
Devos is as unqualified as Gorsuch is qualified. Will you vote no to be reasonable?
Thanks for the advice to Dems. Glad you are thinking & reading real news. Please consider your voters' voices #noDevos .
if Dem's should to be bipartisan and vote on qualifications, why don't you do the same and vote no on DeVos?
Good God! Stop with the Democrat bashing tweets! That's not your job. Vote No on DeVos. #AnswerThePhone
And Republicans are in danger of having passed the point of no return. Listen to your constituents #NoToDeVos
Sir: We the People ask you to stand up for what you know is right behavior or know you will be forever known as an opportunist.
Your a hypocrite
Democrats are doing what the voters want.  Figure that out now, or figure it out in 2018.
vote NO on Betsy Devos, San Antonio constituent 78258
.@JohnCornyn Please remember you are beholden to the Constitution and us Texans before Party or President.
@DianneFeinstein answered perfectly on Fox News Sunday.
Who falls inline behind the lawlessness of the draft-dodging Donald Trump? You do! Vote no on Betsy DeVos.
I get having a President with 0 Govt experience running the country but at least surround him with people who do
#votehimout2020
#BetsyDeVos You negate all the good you say voting for @BetsyDeVos. She is not the best choice and you know it.
it was petty and plain wrong for republicans to fail to do their jobs by blocking consideration of Garland.
no comment on the stupid remarks made by @realDonaldTrump on the judge????? You have no balls!
@AaronBlake All of you are in real danger of underplaying the severity of destruction of American values by @realDonaldTrump.
you need to resign!
I am a Dem and I agree. Confirm SCOTUS. Reject DeVoss. Surely even Repubs No she is Inappropriate choice?
Over playing their hand?!  Karma IS a real "b" now isn't she?
let other GOP senators take the lead on ensuring trump doesn't drag the constitution through the mud.
really?   Guns in the hands of the mentally ill is ok with you?
You want the Dems to play nice. When the GOP never does.
Dems are not playing nice or you blind?
Lets be clear neither side place nice. why should the Dems bend.
Dems in Washington are listening to their constituents.  They're minding their bosses.  Are you?  No on Devos.
.@JohnCornyn @washingtonpost Are you paying ANY attention to the ppl of this country?  @SenateDems are supporting their constituents. Try it
You obviously are focused on the wrong problem and fighting the wrong fight ... again.
You wouldn't even give Garland a hearing. Of course Democrats are irritated.
that's right, they are, but so are the R's. Don't forget Obama's first midterm, and R's didn't win the pop vote
for a senator with VERY low name recognition at home in TX, u should worry about listening to your constituents
to the American people
All Trump's picks are suspect and should be extremely vetted for 18-24 months or until the country is returned
--Have you had a chance to review your constituents requests about Betsy DeVos yet? Please vote NO
us vs them #partyovercountry #nointegrity
Let's see who is over reaching when POTUS revokes NAFTA and crashes the TX econimy
At what point did you decide to rubber stamp Trump and ignore Texans? Pls take integrity lessons from Sen McCain. #noDevos
I would appreciate seeing more info about what you are doing every day in washington on your twitter feed, please.
...please go after every red state Democrat!
YOU are in real danger of overplaying and the American people will stand up to you and your billionaire friends!
you support an illiterate racist sociopath with 0 empathy. He is grossly unfit to serve.
why don't you stop whining about how terrible the dems are and start representing ALL your constituents
texas may stay red, but we have same day registration for primaries
people will remember Republican President Trump. They will remember Devos as blatant pay2play.
Good to see that article. We'd be happier if you told us what you plan to do about Trump putting Bannon on the security Council
you are in danger of burning your base. Vote no on DeVos.
Many logical points in article. Will the GOP consider Rule XIX as an alternative to going nuclear? #SCOTUS
please vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch.
Why is it your interest to constantly ice out 1 of 2 parties? You represent many Dems & we want to move forward, not sideways.
This is not constructive, like voting for DeVos. Vote no. #noDevos
demoncrats are already dead to most of America.. let the left coast rot and the east coast bloat... both useless
and you have a chance to #DumpDeVos
not like Repubes are any better
Your partisanship is showing Sen. Cornyn.
I remember no WMD we squandered trillions so we pay more for gas liars.https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChemicalWeapons?src=hash …
they are showing their true colors and they are not red white and blue
John Cornyn VOTE NO ON DEVOS, your voice mail flooded, can't leave messages
.@JohnCornyn @washingtonpost Vote no on DeVos if you don't want to lose your seat. #theEyesOfTexasAreUponYou
Senators the simply repost article headlines and cower to an unpopular Pres should consider new bots for Twitter
You, sir, should be standing with them. What Republicans did to Garland was a flagrant disregard for our constitutional process.
don't you think that the Dems are listening to their base? You need to listen too. #VoteNoDevos
vote NO on DeVos
You didn't when we had a great President Obama , we know your interest is breaking our countries middle class with war and gas.
they have already lost. keep moving forward towards the goal. ignore them.
Please get to the issues. We'd like to know your thoughts on DeVos and Trump's Putin comments. Thanks.
Perhaps the Repubs lwho have embraced Trump & his 20!! EOs have overplayed you hand. I'm a Texan, I vote, I see.
No they r not. U did
If anyone is in danger of overplaying, it's you guys. We are as bad as Putin? Shame on you.
please have  sessions confirmed asap. devos 2nd. tnx
you do realize that you represent A LOT of Democrats. YOU chose not to hear Garland. Y'ALL made this political.
Vote NO on DeVos. She is unqualified.
u missed this part "first 12 days in office have been marked by controversy, division (even among Republicans)"
Do you have ANY opinions other than Dems = bad? This Independent thinks it might be because you know that...
your policies are not good for your constituents. Keep that hatred of Dems up so they won't notice! 
(P.S. Too late! We've already noticed!)
MERRICK GARLAND. Get it?
@GOP @SpeakerRyan You are 100% percent responsible for our shame that is DJT!  IMPEACH HIM!
I pray you recover quickly from the head injury causing your amnesia.
Still more worried about party than Texas children?  Vote no on Devos.
lol, you forget what Republicans did with Obama nomination. Why can you do it and they cant
Republicans are in real danger of crimes against humanity.  Americans are being gaslit by this President.
I've been praying: take a good look at DeVos. She may not be the one
I've been praying:  Gorsuch must go through
worry about your own cancerous party. #crosscheck #votersuppression will prove to be last nail in GOP coffin.
as constituent, I need to know if you agree or disagree with federal judges including W. appointee that ban is unconstitutional
you represent me - not the other way around - and I need to know how I'm being represented on a national level.
I'm not sure what else I can do to feel like you care. Twitter, Facebook, phone, email. Running out of methods. Answer us please
When even the Wamazon Post is saying this, you know Dems are sweating. BTW @SenatorSessions nuclear- whatever it takes! prayers
says the ubstructionist from Tecas.
