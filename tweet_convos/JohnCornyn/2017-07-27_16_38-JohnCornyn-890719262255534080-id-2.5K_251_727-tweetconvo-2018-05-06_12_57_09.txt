You are making it collapse. You could fix it.
ACA was collapsing way before. Not their fault. But they are not wanting to help anyone but themselves.
Republicans have been underfunding ACA for years, trying to make it fail.
Would like to see it done right. Bottom line. Dems and Republicans think we are all fools. Pitting us against each other for their benefit.
No. Republicans are just evil. Scratched & clawed over past 7 years to try & make #Obamacare fail. History will not be kind to them.
Or sneak it through so 16,000,000 Americans lose coverage by your buddy Mitch. Liars and cowards is all I see here Paul with your boy Trump
The skinny bill will collapse the individual market.  Many wonderful Americans get their health insurance from the individual market.
They don't care about the individual market. It went bad under ACA. Will be worse under skinny bill. They don't care. They don't use it.
Some people seems to forget "if you can't change something perhaps you should change the way you are thinking"
Stand up to Trump!
The ACA saves millions of lives. Do not repeal and replace. This is an issue we should all agree on. Affordable healthcare for all.
Youre leaving out the millions that it doesn't help. It can't be helped saved & no one wants him to. It's funded by fraud
maybe you dont care about your family, but you are confused.  The awful GOP plan left 32 mill w/o.
Lie. #ACA is not collapsing. It has helped veterans, the 53% of families who have a preext cndtn, entreprnrs launch startups.
Only 2 insurers last year, crippling deductible, 2 kids apspergers, no access to care, 6k medical debt. ACA NOT working. Both sides to blame
I like Obamacare. My monthly premiums R much lower, but I pay most of my doctor visits.
For seven years you are bickering and you don't have a healthcare replacement, how can people trust you you ?
Repair and strengthen the ACA.  That's what Americans need.
RIP @GOP. Only an idiot would vote for a half assed bill written on a napkin that effects millions and 1/6 of economy. So irresponsible!
quit lying.
The Senate should NEVER pass something that they all KNOW is bad?
No....not collapsing.  Y'all making healthcare problematic by trying to repeal and have 0 adequate replacement.  But, y'all get rich tho.
A very very disappointing Senate!!
ONLY because the @GOP is purposefully sabotaging it! Y'all could have worked to make it better, more affordable, but REPEAL is all you want.
Keep saying it, soon enough you may believe it.
Liar!
Spineless soulless political insider hack says words that mean nothing. Saved you a minute
Liar.

I urge u to stand down the vote & work w/ @SenateDems on an ACA Repair bill. Keep our care safe, don't destroy it 2nite for political gain.

Everyone knows this is all about satisfying promises to donors and not to the people they are supposed to be serving so why bother w/bullsht
When you say "we" you mean a bunch of craven @GOP senators, right?
Did you loose your pacifier? I hear alot of crying. Guess what? NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK!
That is a thing that happens when you pull the rug out from something.
Stop the nonsense. Your approval rating is below zero
@GOP controlled #Congress & #WhiteHouse are collapsing, hurting & failing #American #families on #Healthcare.#Obamacare #Resist #Resistance
Keep it up LyingRyan everyone knows this BS is about getting a tax cut to the richest Americans while GOP withholds fixing the current law
No, you and the rest of the GOP sabotaging the ACA is the real issue that needs to be fixed.
Perhaps you could work a LOT harder to make this process transparent to the American people instead of voting at 10 PM.
I'm going to play a sound for you.

Ready?
The ACA saves American lives.  It's not collapsing, it's being sabotaged.

Try again - it's you who's collapsed & come up short EVEN with an 8yr window of empty promises!
Have RESPECT for Pres Obama !
Talk is Cheap
Another R failure. What will it take? You aren't affected so really why should you care.
Paul-Americans want more services for less money. That is not a conservative plan.will you satisfy the people or stick to conservative ways?
Leaving 20 million Americans uninsured.  Make Who Great Again?
It gives 20 million the choice they don't have now. If I don't want and don't buy, I get fined? Only forced 3rd party sale in history of usa
You are a total fraud!  You and your talk radio henchman have lied about healthcare  for years and now your base isn't ready for reality!
Americans need the protections of the ACA.  Americans deserve the protections of the ACA.
Get to work on fixing it instead of replacing it with nothing
Paul, love ya.  You've totally fucked this up.  Totally.
@JohnCornyn except that it is not collapsing due to ACA itself. Rather issues are caused by GOP sabotage.

If you really intended to help American families, you wouldn't have to repeat lies about programs you want to kill.
...AND REPUBLICANS DO NOTHING!!!  I'm so tired of supporting wieners who get nothing done!!!
working together
Coward, jealous liar. Sleep on that. Hating Barack Obama  does not help sick people. ACA was a GOP plan.
You don't need to do anything, simply let your committees do their work via regular order. Call it Ryancare, Obamacare should be fixed now.
why is all you can complain about Obamacare, while letting your executive branch run amuck and ruin our democracy?!!
It's collapsing because GOP is constantly undermining it!

Just in case helpful @GOP, here's @Scholastic on How a Bill Becomes a Law:
#1 step Draft a Bill (voting comes later) 
Without Obamacare's patient protections I would be dead and my son would never have been born. #HowTheACASavedMyLife
What a beautiful boy!
Thank you!
The CBO has stated the ACA insures millions more than all Republican proposals.  Stop playing your political game & help make ACA better.
Since when are political promises more  important than people's health?
You, Trump and the GOP are the only ones hurting America!

Chilling photo. Serial murderer may be the charge.

Do something and talk to Republicans hot mic incident
After seven years, Paul, and nothing done, get a life!
while 44 members on both sides work hard to fix problems putting country 1st, you and Trump put ego 1st by destroying hc.
"Obamacare is failing" bc GOP states refused Medicaid expansion. Only repeal effort s/b to provide universal healthcare for all Americans.
REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID NO FROM DAY 1 -   Then sabotaged the ACA.     Obamacare is NOT collapsing - failing due to republicans
Yes your causing it to collapse and hopefully ever American takes notice that the Republicans are the reason for failure.

WHEN ARE YOU  GONNA STAND UP FOR THIS COUNTRY AND GET RID OF THIS EMBARRASSMENT  OF A PRESIDENT!!!!
Actually @SpeakerRyan the @GOP is collapsing. The benefit to America will last for generations. #Kennedy2020
Liar
U r lying to the American people. U r looking to reduce taxes on rich/cut medicaid/hurt those w/pre-existing conditions. Cruel.
GOP leaders say it’s time for Senate to move on from health care
there are 44 on both sides working to fix it and put Americans 1st.  Ryan says no.  Let them suffer w/o hc until Ryan wins.
Stop worrying about Obama and the ACA fix medical care. If politicians cared about citizens this would have been done 20 years ago.
When did you forget you're here to serve the people of this country, not to push the agenda of that joke in the WH?
How myopic you are. You don't see how many are saving their lives. Because Ocare. My wife is one of them. I will never believe you.
GOP is a joke.. How many millions of dollars were raised with the promise of REPEAL AND REPLACE....
The American People like Rand Paul's plan
Look at history of Medicare, ACA is good that needs some minor fixes. Look at history of Medicare & just do the amendments that are needed
"Largest Obamacare insurer sees strong profits in ACA market despite 'headline noise' of repeal"
@berthacoombs profitable to be a near-monopoly on the exchanges, with premiums through the roof. Well done, ACA.
Simple fixes to create competitive markets if GOP works with Democrats. GOP prefers to sabotage markets. See @charles_gaba Chafor info
Competition across borders is needed. No sabotage needed. ACA was not designed to be sustainable
Or were you always a self serving liar?
This is easy. You get the insurance you're forcing on us, or we get the insurance you have. Don't your constituents deserve the best?
The GOP spent 7 YEARS OBSTRUCTING Obama. "Life is an echo. What you send out, comes back. What you sow, you reap. What you give, you get.
Instead of going behind closed doors, include the Dems and sit down and fix ACA.  Do it for Americans not for power or greed!
Think you might have had a hand in the collapse?
We are not stupid. We see how we get fucked over while the 1% get tax breaks. This is not a healthcare bill- it's wealthcare. UNACCEPTABLE.
The best thing that comes from all of this is that "Ryan-McConnellism" is dead as of now, and we get back a more moderate Republican party.
Don't get me wrong, they still won't impeach Trump, but we might end up with a VERY slightly more Parliamentarian legislative branch.
Fix it don't repeal it. Make sure we all have insurance and pre e existing conditions are covered. Make a stand! For once!
Pre existing condition clause he doesn't care at all. So my daughter will lose her coverage. To hell with this bigot
Why some republicans senator don't want to vote for a fraudulent bill. Why Smell fishy the skinny bill.
@DavidYankovich takes your seat next election
Why don't you try reining in the ins. cos. Stop them from price gouging.
only you want to take their healthcare away, you want to line the pockets of your donors!
Let it fail you and the dnc can eat crow for doing it in the first place.
You do know that out of all modern capitalist economies the USA is the only one not to have universal health?
You're a liar and you suck. Go to confession
To bad, so sad!   I'm an American and doing just fine on Obama Care.
No, it's not. Obamacare is taxing the wealthiest Americans so every American can have healthcare. But you ONLY care about wealthy Americans!
Why not take the taxcut out of the defense budget? @SpeakerRyan could try a conservative idea and use the bombs we already have. Penny wise.
So why aren't you doing a straight repeal vote like you did dozens of times when Obama was @POTUS ? Oh, yeah, Trump would actually sign it.
Nothing like the damage you clowns are gonna do don't you have a date with the insurance companies
Yet you are failing to #FullRepeal
Why has the Congress exempted them from their own health bill? Because it stinks!
Please stop lying all week and going to church on Sunday. That doesn't make it ok to lie and try to hurt people.
Very si.ple fix, tour constituents want it, want the benefits and YOU know it
Liar. 
Single Payer System
Could u please put your spine in?  Stop being afraid of @realDonaldTrump!! Put your big boy pants on & fight for our most fragile citizens.
You want to cleanup The repeal  issue, you can by not funding!  Just Do It!
Please STOP! Anything u vote on will be the destruction of healthcare for millions. Put our welfare above partisanship, Repair not repeal!
STOP TRYING TO KILL US.
the politicians don't like the taxpayers or they would put us on the same insurance they have because we pay for their ins
No need to reinvent the wheel! Just repair problems with the ACA,  like done with Medicare when it was new! No to skinny bill.
@SpeakerRyan America knows @GOP is doing everything they can to make it collapse. You just can't let a dem bill go can you, petty politics
YOU and the GOP are hurting the American. @SenateGOP put #MillionairesOverWorkingClass
Do you damn job. You work for us
Stop cutting the legs off of it and improve it Jack ass. Take the highroad and actually do something for the majority of this country
#GOP

#SkinnyRepeal

@speakerryan is lyin'.
GOP Reps talking now of Vote and to trump.
Obamacare is collapsing and hurting American families. We have to keep working at this until we get the job done. http://spkrryan.us/2h7Aue1  
I wish we could put hlth insurance back to the way it was before the aca. My daughter has a prescription that was $10, now $194
Hush. U have lost all credibility with normal people who fight bigotry and stand up for their friends
We won't forget what you are doing today.
Appalling how Republican elite endeavor to deceive the American people!These agents of chaos & hatred don't care one cm about middle America
You e had applicable time if you had nothing in 7 yrs you won't have it today. Fix the broken problems and move forward
Hurting American families?  Your crazier than Trump. The ACA had made it possible for some to get needed care&made freeloaders buy insurance

Where could we find money for sick people? 
You are lying solely for the sake of putting anther notch in your belt. How do you sleep at night?
The House plan is just as awful, and you know it. Bunch of ghouls.
You are a bad person and a terrible leader. What's happening now is your fault because you are weak and self serving
Blah blah blah-all we hear when you talk about  repealing the ACA is "get rid of everything the black president did". It's pathetic! Fix it!
You have been mercilessly sabotaging the Affordable Care Act since Day One because you hate humanity. #Resist #SaveACA #NoRepeal #NoGOPcare
It failed and you will continue to fail since the agenda of this WH is to divide & harm our democracy!
Sure hope so it's not looking good for the home team just have to vote all out of office not just a few all easy fix just lazy politicians

You & #Trump have been systematically defunding the ACA so u could push ur shit plan & give tax credits to wealthy
.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how Obamacare isn't dying — Trump is purposefully killing it 
Blah, blah, blah.....pass something!
If you would stop defunding it, it would not be the monster you are making it out to be.  Your lies are getting tired.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain no promise say NO
That's a lie - despite the exec's sabotage of markets it's still working. Only in Repub. counties are the markets not functioning properly.

Get real! It's not simply winning a vote!!!! It's FIXING the problem... that's your JOB!
You do not work for American familiesSir. You work for those who fund your stay in DC. Stop using us as props.
We voters just don't get what's so hard to repeal obamacare?  We are beyond frustrated, we're angry.
YOU know, as well as I do, GOP worked along w/ insurance companies to intentionally undermine ACA out of spite. #fixnotnix #aca
I bet Ryan is the leaker!!!
WRONG!! You ALL could have worked for, helped, gotten the CLEAN, FULL REPEAL done! YOU chose not to! All of you (RINOs) update your resume`!
You are a Liar.
We ALL know you and your greedy goons sabotaged it. You're in the pocket of the INSURANCE INDUSTRY.
RYAN IS A FUCKING #LIAR! OBAMACARE IS NOT COLLAPSING! THE GOP AND THIS ADMIN ARE COLLAPSING! GOP Greedy Con men and racists
Blah, blah, blah... You lie
You are liar and continue to spread lies soon @SpeakerRyan you and your @gop cronies will be murderers because u destroyed healthcare
Never forget, the ACA was a GOP idea. If it were called Romney Care they would all support it.
As long as you and your coworkers have to use the insurance market you create, ill support it. Otherwise, find a new job.
You could work to fix it and save lives. You won't because you still suck up to the Cheeto.
YOU! And the GOP are hurting American obama care is NOT! Collapsing , your putting American lives in danger but you don't care
Stop lying @SpeakerRyan you have as little credability as Trump or Kellyanne Conway
You will cave to Trump and pass a crappy health care bill. Party over country.
#keepurpromise
Randy Bryce is right -Ryan is wrong
Not having a replacement ready to go has earned U an F w/ American People!
The silver lining in this legislative abortion is that you own all healthcare outcomes now
Where were you @SpeakerRyan when the numerous town halls took place? Rs LIE about Ocare being "a disaster" Hope you pay for this crap.
Since the Republicans can't  get Obamacare repealed, I will be voting Libertarian next time.  Major disappointment!
http://www.hsaportal.com  #tcot
Well you own this mess now. Good luck when ppl lose coverage under trump care.  OWN IT.
You need to quit while your ahead , your wealth care plans will Fail
Then next time don't draft a bill in secret w just a few members, demand a vote b4 a final CBO score and not waiting to hear from the people
Its collapsing because of YOU. Read this :  top insurance CEOs blame all republicans. OWN IT!
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THE TAX CUT FOR THE RICH...cause that' s what ur heath care bill is about .WHY DONT U TAKE IT IF U THINK ITS  SO GREAT
ACA was created by the Heritage Foundation plan.  If a conservative think tank's answers aren't good enough, what is?
You're working yourself right out of your job, keep it up! 
#AmericaHatesYou 
#NoTrumpcareForUs
