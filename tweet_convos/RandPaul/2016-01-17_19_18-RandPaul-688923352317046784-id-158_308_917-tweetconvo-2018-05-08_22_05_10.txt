@RandPaul @joanwalsh Not here. Worry about your own debate. Oh wait.....
I believe @RandPaul belonged in the last debate so I'm not mocking him @BluthX
@joanwalsh @RandPaul @BluthX He throws shade every chance he gets w/ weak,silly jabs. I'll spare his teeth #YouKnowWhatsWrongWithWhitePeople
@AmbitDiva @joanwalsh @RandPaul ...I do think he set himself up, but out of respect for Joan shouldn't have used her RT to zing him
@BluthX @joanwalsh @RandPaul Zing him?  I already broke his jaw on a previous tweet. Just stated the obvious and.Joan can speak 4 herself.
@AmbitDiva @joanwalsh @RandPaul I was talking about me zinging him. Joan did speak 4 herself, telling me she wasn't mocking him after I did
@BluthX @joanwalsh @RandPaul lolz, needed to revisit the thread..my bad!  Not used 2 guys apologizing 4 zingers. Is that passive aggressive?
@AmbitDiva @joanwalsh @RandPaul Lol..no, just respect Joan a lot &knew she didn't mean it that way. No worries, zingers flying all ways! : )
@RandPaul u just angry every1 knows u r 1 of the most incompetent republicans in the history of this country! Including Trump! #DemDebate
@RandPaul That would have made this debate even more entertaining than it already was over the GOP debates.
@RandPaul It needed an enema. @3GurlzArt
@RandPaul Ted Nugent and Huckabee plus u can play skin flute.
@RandPaul well it can't be a three hour clown show like #GOPDebate
@RandPaul And bourbon. Mostly bourbon.
@cameronaubernon @RandPaul Poor Cameron. It hurts his head when he listens to 3 intelligent ppl discuss actual issues. Go watch Nickelodeon.
@RandPaul @RealEmmaGoldman I recommended the same for the Republican debate. Thank you for your suggestion, nonetheless.
@RandPaul Oh another meaningless jab from the Republican water boy.
@RandPaul couldn't watch. can't look at either one of them.
@RandPaul are we talking about a famous band here, or a full on marching band?
@RandPaul who would you want to play?
@RandPaul I thought Martin O'Malley was going to be the entertainment.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul : come on Rand, you know they did well!! #UfeelingtheBern
@RandPaul Very rude, Sir.
.@RandPaul @_lonely_way needs an expert on euthanasia because its painfully boring me to death
@RandPaul it's putting me to sleep
@RandPaul Only when you are in the debate Dr. Paul...
@RandPaul @joanwalsh   NOPE!
@RandPaul yes "Gong Show". Can someone get Chuck Barris back plz
@RandPaul joke is on you
@RandPaul you and Huckabee should start a jug band. I bet you play a mean washboard
@RandPaul O'Malley should have pulled out his guitar, his band has got some great songs! #OMalleysMarch @MartinOMalley #DemDebate
@RandPaul hey folks, it's Mr Irrelevant!!!!!
@RandPaul who do you think should have played?
@RandPaul sponsored by your local workers union!
@RandPaul LOL and where have you been? Oh yeah not at the debates
@RandPaul u are NOT ALLOWED at the 
Grown-Ups table!!
@RandPaul @joanwalsh U didn't even attend Ur last debate U sat out like spoiled child. U have no grounds to comment on those who show up
@RandPaul little man syndrome. Your opinion means diddly squat, you can't even get on the main stage with the biggest asses in the GOP
@RandPaul Or Katy Perry and the lefty shark.
@RandPaul  The band @Disturbed can play 'Another Way to Die' to match her foreign policy talk, while she checks her depends. #RandRally
@RandPaul at least I'm getting invited to them Paul!  Tu Papi is not too happy about you!  #DemDebate
@RandPaul of course you do. Money money money party. #DemDebate
@RandPaul I think a stand up comedian would've more appropriate for halftime #DemDebate
You need to leave #Republican dark side #warmongers who block you out of debates and join the political revolution @RandPaul #DemDebate
@RandPaul @joanwalsh 
Pithy comments coming from a candidate seated at the kiddie table
@RandPaul at least they're discussing real problems, real solutions/ you know you're not a real Republican, Rand-you've got a sense of humor
@RandPaul GOp debates sorriest clown show ever. How can you even compare except for HRC
.@randpaul Nope, just you. #DemDebate
@RandPaul Said by a member of the clown "show".
@RandPaul @phish?
@RandPaul at least they're talking about reality and us
@RandPaul then the GOP needs to get a guy putting his head in a lions mouth to complete the circus. U already have the clowns
@RandPaul who are u? U don't even believe in climate change, so go with the GOP deniers who don't believe the 99.99%+ of climate scientists
@RandPaul do you think anybody in the audience knows that Andrea Mitchell is married to Alan Greenspan Clinton's buddy
@RandPaul 
I was wondering when Dan Patrick would review the highlight real. Just another TV show
#Randpaul #DemDebate
@RandPaul Yes, they needed the Police to play their theme song.
@RandPaul I'm sorry, are you somehow relevant?
@RandPaul @joanwalsh How about a band led by you on the tambourine?? and donald "bubble head" trump on the marimba? both in bikini and clefs
@RandPaul @fetasue more like an enema
@RandPaul unlike the hope debate that u were not invited this is a debate of subtance
@RandPaul maybe a clown? Are you available?
@RandPaul @joanwalsh like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT2oAYGkB3c …
@RandPaul Maybe at the next kiddie table debate you can invite Aqua Buddha.
@RandPaul @joanwalsh we don't have the clown car but the honest issue discussion works for us
@RandPaul they are so civil it's  boring...where's the yelling? Where's the insults? as an American I want violence or I'm not interested.
@RandPaul at least they don't have so many clowns. #DemsDebate
@RandPaul @joanwalsh you mad bro?
@randpaul Totally man!!
@RandPaul you are confusing parties again.
@RandPaul is trying to be relevant by trolling #DemDebate. Go play w/ @TheRealDonaldTrump @news_24_365
@ChristineIAm @RandPaul @LeslieNeidig if he wanted to flap his lips he should have shown up to his own debate
@nicolerclarke @randpaul Well, the #DEMDebate doesn't have the comedy factor of the #GOPDebate, that's for sure.
@RandPaul they spent all of that budget on street artists outside the venue
Anyone thinks that you should be paying more attention to your son and not this debates time length? @RandPaul @joanwalsh
@RandPaul Does #GOPCircus have band for its #uglycatfights?
@randpaul @joanwalsh Yeah... All of you at the kiddie table should play for us!
@RandPaul @joanwalsh. I thought you said good night? Bye
@RandPaul Another debate you weren't invited to ;(
.@RandPaul Could have been you! "Rand Paul and the Other GOP Candidates Who Will Never Be President." Is a mouthful but worth it. #DemDebate
@RandPaul totally agree
@RandPaul 
It needs an open bar... cuz EVERYTHING IS FREE.
@RandPaul @MZHemingway Who are you again?
.@RandPaul I suggested they let Coldplay rehearse for the super bowl but nooo... They apparently have TASTE. #DemDebate
@RandPaul you could be a part of that band now that you are pretty much out of the race
@RandPaul  Felt like that quite bizarre frightening #SWR #DemDebate
@RandPaul @joanwalsh Ya, but this debate is a crap ton better than the #GOPDebates
@RandPaul Peter, Paul and Mary perhaps ? ... it would be fitting.. j/s
@RandPaul nah...the clowns are enuff for this circus @SenSanders @HillaryClinton @MartinOMalley Trump could be the ring leader #DemDebate
True, @RandPaul Dems don't have the same sideshow quality as the republican debates. No clowns or anything.
@sherisaid @RandPaul What she said.
@ginaruiz lol!
@sherisaid That was classic.
@RandPaul @joanwalsh Yep. They're playing "We Are The Champions."
@RandPaul @joanwalsh And Doritos.
@RandPaul oh, just grow up, little man.
@RandPaul there was certainly time for one
@RandPaul I was thinking of clowns juggling bowling pins and a bear balancing himself on a ball.
@RandPaul. Yes, the Pander Bear Band!
@RandPaul They could have called in Donald Trump's creepy kid band.
@RandPaul does someone have sour grapes for not being invited to a real debate? #loser #DemDebate
@RandPaul #demdebate you and your repub homies need to watch and listen. real issues being debated like adults not children. #Bernie2016
@RandPaul oh my god just shut up, no one thinks you're funny!
@RandPaul I did not bother watching it, I am sick of the Soap Opera/Jerry springer of the conventions of both paties #DemDebate
@RandPaul Back to the kid's table Rand. Your relevance can not be bolstered by attempts at snark.
@RandPaul As long as we don't see any exposed nipples...
@RandPaul I would not watch it if @BernieSanders would pay me free money  lol wake up Bernie nothing in life is free
@RandPaul 
No band, including the great Bob Seger, would help this boring debacle.
@RandPaul no. Need to get another bottle to continue drinking game
@RandPaul You certainly have much to say for someone that didn't even make his party's last debate. Then had a tantrum over the kiddie table
@RandPaul #randrally
@RandPaul I just broke out the banjo!
@RandPaul go back to watching the Cartoon Network..are you this desperate for attention?
@RandPaul It's fun having you hanging out with the Dems!
@RandPaul is there ever a time when you guys don't pander to your base? Dems aren't your enemies. You ALL work for us!
@kato3000 @RandPaul 
@RandPaul anyone else think a presidential candidate like @RandPaul should be less snarky?
@RandPaul The who? Won't be fooled again?
@RandPaul The only thing that could save #DemDebate is if @RandPaul was there to TKO them #StandWithRand
@RandPaul more cow bell!
@RandPaul Didn't I see you at the kids' table last week?
@RandPaul why, cause they're not instigating fear and hatred towards muslim people and are actually discussing important issues unlike REPs?
@RandPaul okay, we agree on one thing I guess.
@RandPaul bring on @CurtsingerEli
@RandPaul Hanson!!
@RandPaul Dixieland?
@RandPaul that's actually awesome.....
@RandPaul and a beer commercial #DemDebate #RandPaul2016
@RandPaul and puppies...
@RandPaul yes -
@RandPaul  no but you need a clown suit.
@RandPaul Yes, the same band the Titanic had. #demdebate
@RandPaul Nickleback
@RandPaul Cheerleaders would have been better;)
@RandPaul why don't you worry about trump lol
@RandPaul These are the worst Three stooges impersonators I've ever seen.
@RandPaul no, that's what i think about the Republican Debates
@RandPaul Yes, but someone really lame. Is Creed available?
@RandPaul Hey, at least they are on the stage!
@RandPaul @sublime ?
@RandPaul childlike remarks instead of actual rebuddles.
@RandPaul Maybe @RealBenCarson
@RandPaul needs a doctor to resuscitate my dying brain cells!
@RandPaul you stole my idea ¬_¬
@RandPaul this entire debate is a joke.
@RandPaul yea  a mariachi would be fitting
@RandPaul Yes who plays the clown car music anyway
@RandPaul hmm maybe "the irrationals"
@RandPaul Humble Pie?
@RandPaul and a wardrobe malfunction
@RandPaul there's no money to book one
@RandPaul leave the musical acts to Trumps circus of a campaign Doc
@lipskey @RandPaul Donkey show is the real circus now that elephants are being retired.
@RandPaul It needs new actors #DemDebate
@RandPaul call @realDonaldTrump he’s got some elephants and dancing kids
@RandPaul which band?
@libertywoody @RandPaul Rage + System of a Down.
@RandPaul Bruno Mars would KILL it!
@RandPaul like the #SOTU ?
@RandPaul Is Hillary doing good tonight?
@jesselaymen @RandPaul the only way she would be doing good is if she was in prison #HillaryForPrison2016 #StandWithRand #DemDebate
