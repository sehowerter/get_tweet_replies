Hey, did you notice there was an earthquake in Mexico? Have you sent them aid, like Mexico did for us?
Wow. Denying climate change is getting expensive!
Obama didn't deny climate change and he prevented all those hurricanes right?
We need to attack north Korea don't let them attack us. Thank you.
Then get down to your local recruiting station and enlist in the Army or USMC.
Why?
But global warming is still fake, right???
Yep, still fake. Made up for certain people to make millions and fly their private jets around. @algore
@tom812Homer if I had I private jet I would let you borrow it and fly to Florida.
Oh, thank you so much . I love you too.
Way to get half of America to just sit out the storm and wait. #imnotdoinganythinghesays
Something tells me that if Mar-A-Lago is damaged  it's going to cost taxpayers not Trump. He will find a way to rip us off.
Because we hate him
I know you think climate change is a Chinese hoax, but we can expect more hurricanes and greater intensity. Adult presidents plan ahead.
Yes and adult citizens don't expect their leaders to be able to change the weather
Mr. Kestenbaum, if you don't think humans can affect the weather, you can plan ahead to be able to cope with natural disasters.
True. It's not the really the President's job to do city planning though
Not city planning. But this president proposed reducing FEMA funds. A conservative put money away for a rainy day. Literally!
Have you noticed the insane libs on Trump tweets. They tweet 20+ responses. Mental disorder. No one cares what you think losers. Trump won!
I have seen them. I don't pay attention 2 them.
TRUMP WON. people need 2 move on, get jobs, change their loves for better. #MAGA
Agreed. However I find the numerous tweets and seething rage indicative of their mental instability
Their brains have been fried by the media, democrats, parents, peers, ex muzzie prez. They consume lies as truth.
You did not want to sign in Paris for renewable energy. Global warming, It's time to start taking this seriously, and take action worldwide.
So signing a piece of paper would stop the hurricane?
Refusing to use renewable energy and continuing to collaborate on global warming will help more hurricanes.  Take care of the planet more!!!
1935 Labor Day hurricane

They had a quick blurbing and basically made him 'look good'.
Couldnt happen to a nicer guy!
@POTUS keep us in your prayers we will for survive as for the haters saying Florida is deserving because the Democratic State voted you in
Praying for y'all now.
We need it in abubdance 
At least Irma will pass soon , but we still have to deal with your BS , sad but true !
When I'm bored I just read replies to Trumps from both lefties and righties.
Too much fun, comebacks and stomach ache 
Irma is giving the Blowhard-in-Chief a run for his money. Will his fragile ego survive not being the center of attention for 72+ hours?
Lead by example.
They need to send more help to evaluate. Family members say no gas left & airfare too much for big families with lots of kids.
Trump, scientists have been telling us these things will keep happening more frequently & more severe!  Believe in the science!!!!


How about offering free shelter in those hotels of yours to those seeking help in FL, instead of hiking up prices for the weekend.#FakePres

This is why we shouldn't have pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. It's only gonna get worse!  You made a bad choice pulling out!
@LindaKo23218145 trump, I'm wondering with all these hurricanes & devistation, what you think of the climate change agreement now? Bad idea!

Thank God for Tom Fitton, he is doing the job the DOJ should be! He is a true Patriot! Hill-Billy & Co.'s days are numbered, finally! MAGA
We love our Commander In Chief#USAMilitaryFirst
Trump to military: 'I will always have your back'
Stay Safe May Allah protect you all #Florida #Irma2017 #HurricaineIrma  I wish i can help, yet all I can do is Praying
A photo of the largest catastrophe in history pretty much sums up the #DopeyDonald regime. Sad! #NotMyPresident #SoCalledPresident
Hey @Twitter heard you were caught deleting pro Trump tweets. Explains why I only see negative
U don't believe in reality OR science. I'm amazed u're not telling ur clueless, followers #Irma is 'fake news' made up by 'liberal media'.
Hello this is donnie your weather man trying to sound like I give a about those in danger of Irma. It's just my attempt to appear human.
Everyday from Buffoon in Chief!
The perpetual liar is asking people to heed what he says? Good luck with that.
@VanityFair International Best Dressed NOT @FLOTUS
 
From #Canada150 WITH LOVE @BarackObama @ObamaFamily
Are you still convinced pulling out of the Paris agreement was a good idea? How about a day of science instead of a day of prayer?
If only being in the Paris agreement would have stopped this. Oh wait...
HATER-IN-CHIEF How are your buildings doing? #IrmaHurricane2017 #Miami #ImpeachTrump @LatinosMatter @Latina1949
Maybe you'll take the scientists words over your own tiny minds words! But, oh no, you have the greatest most brilliant mind in the world!
If you want to help Mr. Trump, it'd help if you listened to scientists about #climatechange. I'm sure they'd explain it to you if you ask.
But but if it's more than one page and doesn't have pictures well then it doesn't count
I encourage the Trumps to ride out the storm in a mobile home in Key West 
Irma is a bigger blowhard than The Donald!
when is congress going to do the right thing and impeach you or use the 25th on you
Cuba sd waves are 16-24 feet high! Winds so hard it broke the equip.used to measure wind speed. Prayers! #HurricaneIrma
Good lookin' out, POTUS! Thank you for all your love and support for us Floridians and our brothers and sisters in Texas. #HurricaneIrma
Just to be 100% sure. This isn't a hoax by the liberal mainstream media?? A ploy to advance global warming narrative? Like Rush said?
Thank You for your Leadership & involvement.  With you Sir to MAGA!
NO ONE needs advice from you, fool. Leave it alone. We already HAVE competent and sincere local officials. #ShutUpTrump!!
Hey look! The p&@sy grabber is pretending to be a leader.
Harvey. It makes no sense. He's helping, and you aren't. Seems hypocritical and fishy to me.
I built our HS library through fundraising
Still don't believe in climate change?!
Mr president when will Americans be helped in st. Maarten???? The situation is getting very ugly and no American aide is in site...
Ps..do you regret what you've done to FEMA??

Yes  2020  any my score 498view millions every phone people around the world  just for Trump USA let's God protections
Yes Thanksgiving for messages so much i am praying for Puerto Rico in amen and USA God watching USA forever and Puerto Rico love USA
Are there any #WorldLeaders who are willing to send a #ship with water food & medicine to #PuertoRico ? #Trump is NOT helping our people.
I encourage you to stop denying #ClimateChange and #ScientificFacts
Trump Administration/ your work on Irma has been unassailably terrific.
So weird. It's like the climate is changing or something.
Thank you for your worries to all the people in Florida   We truly appreciate your kind concern. My niece is there
Or perhaps heed the advice of 97% of scientists who agree climate change is real.
Sorry meant it for the impeachment party

Thank you so much for all you did in Texas after the Hurricane. Port Arthur really appreciates it!
Watching U try to convince ur own "fans" that this storm is REALLY REAL NEWS is disgusting.
#ShameOnRush 
#Shame on #PutinsPuppet
#Impeach
Irma sez: Which way to Mar-A-Lago???
You should heed the advice in regard to dealing with climate change!
I encourage everyone in the path of trump to heed advice of 65% of the American people and impeach him!
Puto
I'm very concerned about some people posting that they are Staying inPlace during Irma! I saw 1 man with his Son! Stating they're staying! 
Good thing #climatechange is #fake #science .... LOL .. ACTUALLY YOU ARE THE #FAKE #PRESIDENT
There will be many more storms like Harvey and Irma if you don't start believing in Climate Change, Mr. President.
Genuine question. Have your thoughts on climate change, changed?
Do u honestly think the entire state of FL is following u on twitter?  Stay in your own lane and let the experts take care of things.
Worst disaster since the 2016 election!
Yikes! Even windier than a speech by The Donald!
Were down here in houston help people with the storm can u donate something anything will help thanks
But not scientists, because what could they possibly know. #POTUSisanidiot
I wish you come to FL and play golf while the hurricane come in. That would be the biggest sacrifice you would do for this country.
wait, what, Irma isnt FAKE NEWS like Rush said?!?!
St. John, USVI is in desperate need of your help. Please send help. US citizens feel forgotten down there.
Nery good
@potus @Whitehouse
...
Going on Day 2, and neither of you have bent your Twitter thumbs to expressing concern about quake in Mexico.
Massive storm #Irma
Donald  in florida  images show grid lock traffic going North and no one going south use south bound road for north bound traffic too
INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT NOT ONE DIME GOES TO ISRAEL WHILE AMERICAN PPL ARE SUFFERING.  HOW BOUT AID TO DETROIT, HOW BOUT AID TO BALTIMORE
Anyone who hinders our border wall shld be arrested for treason. The ppl have spoken loud and clear.
So... You still don't believe in #GlobalWarming worst ever hurricane... And no direct correlation to #GlobalWarming .. #wakeUp

Could climate change breed a whole new category of hurricane? #Irma @earthinstitute w/GISS' Tim Hall   http://goo.gl/82muhw  
Gainesville VA hosp. slams doors on local veterans. Closed during hurricane IRMA. Vet brothers and sisters do not always have family close


AG Sessions-Bow your head in disgrace! Refusing to press charges on Lois Lerner after she targeted conservatives?WTF

 Here's some advice and orders for you from local and state officials, as well as most Americans: RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS OR RESIGN.
#climatechange #buildingcodes #ReaponsibleUrbanPlanning
You DO understand that climate change is making these hurricanes bigger and stronger right?  Side note, the earth is ROUND.  #ignoramus
Dump TRUMP - karma
Getting excited for the trip down to FL? #Irma #Harvey #Liar #Friday #Resist #JailerInChief #Complicit #JaVanka #Russia #Mueller #Racist

Btw what ever happened to that million dollars? #TalkToMuchAndNothingToShow
Our country fought so hard to be great! So instead of getting rid of the good, take away the bad. And with that God bless America.
That Hurricane it si possible, because #GlobalWarming  #hurricaneirma2017
And God's going to just KEEP Blessing you and the U.S for it! Thank You my brother in Christ!
i encourage u to stop being president
#LoisLearner #LOCKHERUP
I'm losing faith in Sessions. Draining the swamp includes prosecuting: 
Clintons
Lois Lerner
Rice…
Warn everyone from Panama City FL to Houston Texas, Irma is going to dance in the Gulf. Fact! I'm in Ft Myers and the path is clear.
It's a CLASS 5
Please resign. 
You embarrass our country.
You degrade our American values.  
Please resign.
Thank you.

But this all fake news isn't it. You told us Climate change was a Chinese scam.
Sir, i have bad news to report.  I'm going to give it to you straight.  You've been had.
You've become #PutinsBitch
Earthquakes 
Severe Droughts - Forest Fires 
Hurricanes - Harvey Irma Jose Katia 
Russian Collusion 
Chinese Hoax ---> #FakeNews
Global warming is real
There are fires happening right now in multiple places in America & the @GOP controlled govt is doing nothing.
Saying that tax-free churches should get reimbursed by FEMA is like saying the Red Cross should get reimbursed, instead of people donating.
But climate change is a hoax made up by China, right cooked don-boy?
You need to heed the advice of scientists who have been telling you climate change is real.  Do something about it!
In China ,There would be big disaster following when eclipse appeared.King criticized himself  to  god. you can pray to god,  Mr trump.
I hope people with common sense use their brains and get out of Dodge don't wait till the storms on top of them
Obama 2020

Did you board up Mar-a-Lago?
Now see, that sounded almost presidential.  Good for you!  Now if you could just admit climate change is a thing...
Last night,I had a long dream,I dreamed I suicided,When I wake up,I can not stop crying.
I encourage you, Mike Pence, and Paul Ryan to stand in the path of Hurricane Irma and rid the world of your existence.
Help us with climate change!  Acknowledge it's real!
What are you doing about all of the Americans stranded on St. Martin at the the American University of the Caribbean?!
I encourage everyone in the path of Donald Trump to #ImpeachTrump
God Bless every life and in the name of Jesus I pray for safety and courage 
God pours his wrath on the US for electing a godless criminal.   Deal with it #trumpsupporters.  Just wait for the locusts...
#MAGA
Almighty Orb, we call on your power to save us from our own oil fueled folly!  (If this doesnt work blame the black guy)- @realDonaldTrump
I encourage you to believe in climate control so these hurricanes can call the fuck down.
I don't believe 1 word you say!  Go Away PLEASE!
I really really hope Irma hits and destroys Maralago!! #ClimateKarmaForTrump
Is it me you are looking for??? I can see it in ur eyes @RealAlexJones #HurricaneJose #HurricanIrma #HurricaneHarvey #hurricaneirma2017
Probably the most rational thing I have seen you tweet.
Look at you pretend you care about others. BTW, those rallies need to end. You won the election so go do your job.
@VanityFair International Best dressed NOT @MELANIATRUMP 

#Obamas #AmericasApeal Classy people, example to new generation. No scadals.
You know it's hitting places besides America, right? Can you think for one second before you start playing w your phone?
Fake news. Climate change isn't real. Fake Hurricane. Right Faux President Trump? #loser
In other words, get the fuck out of Florida and/or find shelter quickly! This includes Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate caretakers.
Have you finally woken up to the fact that global warming is real?! #climatechange #needtoreduceourcarbonfootprint
Have you opened Mar-a-Lago as a shelter, yet? We Twitter shamed Osteen into doing it. We'll do the same to you -- but you have no shame.
How about the fires in Montana and western states. THEY NEED HELP
#StandWithTrump
Wanna take bets that the first report Trump makes after Irma hits the Miami area, is the damage report at Mar-a-Lago? #PrayersForFlorida
And we're there...

Trump -6 times bankrupt,to evade taxes.His word is not worth a cent
Trump thinks it's his job to show us what he watches on TV! Give it up old man
Perhaps its time to rethink you views on climate change
Draining the swamp includes prosecuting Lois Learner, HRC etc. Sessions is a swamp creature covering up FBI/DOJ/IRS felony collusion JUSTICE

Irma is like a climate denier trophy for you. Another one.
NOAA is a federal agency.  
A competent president would include them.
You're very, very bad at this job, and you should #Resign.
(2 days later he re-tweeted this message and corrected to include ALL levels of govt}

...STILL bad at the job, and STILL should #Resign
Some people do not have the resources to do so, no car, disabled, homeless, etc.
Maybe you could, as the president offer them some help, those displaced
