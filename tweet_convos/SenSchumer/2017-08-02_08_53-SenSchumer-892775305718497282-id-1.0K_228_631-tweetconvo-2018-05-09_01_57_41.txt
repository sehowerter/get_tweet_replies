Your kidding right?  This is what Trump ran on, has been trying to do and that you and all your lunatic left partners have been resisting.
Thatsthejoke.jpg
Sorry but that is what Trump has said from the start. Never original
Ever heard of the New Deal?
Nope. Explain
Ever heard of FDR?
Of course
This is basically a copy of Trump's plan. Hypocrites.
Hilarious!!! Trump has no plan. Besides hes being indicted for his treasonous Russian mob connections and for trafickking. Good luck!!
Of course due to ACA stealing my good ins & Leukemia, I only have few yrs left, but "Art of the Deal" They are the best most premium years!
I try to be + as I've lost some of that. Maybe it was democrats telling me that didn't happen for 7 years. I'll work on it.

AZ 113% - 2017
Yes so you agree 100% with Trump, Finally you admit it!
Read a history book. After 1965. And you'll understand why what you're saying doesn't make sense. Dems became Republicans
You're missing the point. Dixie Democrats became Republicans. Republicans once were progressive until they weren't.
It's not a theory. That's historical fact. That's how the South became literally more Red than Blue. Why do u keep talking about the SoL?
Actually, I was just thinking the same about you. And no one cares about Hillary and Bill. Really.
You demonize Trump and yet copy his EXACT trade and job plan
Trump can't write w/o a Sharpie and you think he actually came up with a plan?
Senator, imitation is the truest form of flattery. 
#BetterDeal same as #MAGA 
#Dems Trump's policies enough to imitate them!
164 RT? Probably cause you plagiarized MAGA. Wow.
Trump plagiarized MAGA you hypocrite
Where have I heard this before?  Hmmm....#maga #2020
Really? How hard did you work to put that together? Just pick up a Trump flier?
Hey #realDonaldTrump #ABetterDeal #dimwitocrates 
Chuck must have always cheated by copying off the smartest kid in classes paper.  #plagiarism
Chuckie, Nice try but this is what Trump has been saying for years! You need to come up with something original and not steal Trump's ideas.
Seams like I heard that somewhere.... Did you hear it where I heard it
If I wanted policies of economic nationalism I'd vote republican.
Thank you!
Democrats need to have an agenda for success, in addition to #RESIST
Trump ran on the same thing + boarder control. Your party has lost over 1k seats since Obama. My Q for you: who writes your largest check?
CNN: Trump steals Democrats' "A Better Deal" platform
What about immigration chuck?
This looks like BIG govmt market manipulation. Bad ideas  you value freedom? Don't need govmnt protection just get the hell out of my way!
This is literally Trumpism.
Trumpism is anti-immigrant, anti-pc, anti-regulation, anti-anti bs, you don't even know what trumpism is, trump even admited maga was a joke
THIS JUST IN: @SenSchumer confirms that @realDonaldTrump is the smartest guy he knows and supports his financial plans 100%. #trumped
Umm last time I checked, Dems protect the middle class, GOP the top 1%, I think you've been bamboozled
IBEW LOCAL 3 out on strike for 223 days fighting union BUSTING and the right to negotiate fairly for a contract. We can be your spokesperson
Since I voted for Obama I'm curious as to why none of the things your taking about were not done or brought up for a bite then
Where've I heard this before
That's so funny. Dems so lame they can't make up their own list. 
So now you are running on:
We will only pass @POTUS trade & jobs agenda if you vote him out of office and let us take credit for it?
Where have you been, Chuck?  Better get on board.  That train left six months ago.
Where did you copy that from?  Our great president Trump
Then @realDonaldTrump should get on board and help it  though Congress. Right?
Your #ABetterDeal sounds a lot like #MAGA.  Welcome to Trump train! Would be refreshing to see House/Senate work for agenda of #WeThePeople

ret, Marine, now blue collar, will never feel the burn of Socialism. Rep/Dem jokes #Swamp  @POTUS is #WeThePeople  #WeStandWithPotus.  S/F
You support Trumps agenda now? Awesomeness! @realDonaldTrump @TammyGeraldson @KevinBooker206 @tweettruth2me @_Makada_ @KickinBrass1
I'm happy to hear, but beware of dem treachery. They are attempting to appropriate Trump agenda, present it as "a better deal" & win seats.
I whole heartedly agree Den Mom!   A snake is a snake. 
Don't look now, but it sounds like @POTUS finally got you to use some common sense. #MAGA #Trump2020
this is copy-paste Trump's agenda. Have the Democrats just run out of ideas?
So basically, Trump's plan.  Glad to have you on board the Trump agenda! When should we expect the cries of "Russians" to stop?
This is Trump's EXACT agenda! Lmao. I thought Trump was Hitler? Lol another liberal FAIL. #MAGA #TRUMP #DNC #GOP
Wow. This is Trump's agenda. Have you finally seen the light?
Why wasn't this even considered when Democrats had WH/Congress? Your sincerity is questioned when you only want change after lost elections.
Why didn't you do ANY of this under OBAMA?  Were you deliberately trying to get more cash from lobbyists?  You seem hypocritical
Hmmmm that last one seems a little vague to me 
Finally admitting Obama's legacy has been crap!! About time. Sad part is you were ok with it the last 8 years.......typical politician
Copycats
Dem's couldn't give 'a better deal' in all the yrs they had power, they want you to believe they will do something? #VeryDecievingDNC
So how much of this is real and how much is marketing and messaging? Dems have been for NAFTA, CAFTA & TPP forever. #IllBelieveItWhenISeeIt
Sounds good but when it comes down to it you or other liberals just talk. Since when do liberals give a damn about American workers?
You forgot to add one more thing! Complete repeal of obamacare! I'll take repeal of individual mandate.
That looks familiar! Oh, wait! Now I recognize it. That's President Trumps' plan.
Chucky, you sound like the pres! Too funny, u late to the party!
Nice try Chuck! But Americans will pass on @DNC #ABetterDeal sound like y'all want to Make America Terrible Again
Well Chuck, from the comments it looks like Democrat voters are not stupid like you thought they were. Not falling for this empty shell.
Trying to steal our Presidents Agenda. And you Dems have had >how many years< to do what he is already doing? Pityful old man. Disgusting
Good, now that you are aligned with Trump, you will stop obstructing these initiatives.
So basically #MAGA . We already are with trump.. Thanks
Hey loon stop stealing from POTUS get your own ideas oh well was a thought do do doooooooo DEMe RIP
#ABetterDeal
So you finally agree with what Trump has been saying by quoting him.  Uh hello tap tap did any of you read this? I'll never vote democrat
So, basically, everything that Trump campaigned on. It's Trump's better deal.
So you have been listening to President Trump
#ABetterDeal  looks like the same terrible protectionism that Sanders and Trump advocated. Arsenal of democracy should support free trade
literally word 4 word u just agreed with EVERYTHING Trump has been doing  glad u guys agree now #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Are you finally agreeing that Trump MAGA agenda is the better deal? That is exactly what you copy on your slide. 
isolating the American economy is exactly the answer I would expect from your kind.
Joining the bandwagon, Chuck? @POTUS has been saying this from the beginning...
Man you guys are riding that trump train aye chuckle
I guess it's time the dems follow the leader. This a copy/paste from Chuck... he probably just remove the MAGA at the end.
All you need is #BuildTheWall & pass the #RAISEAct and you might have something there with #ABetterDeal
@SavannahAngel25
@KathyPica1
No Idea "better deal" !!
Is this the "Change" the #NoHopeDope Obama promised?.
How about "More Lies"???
If you want to learn about plagiarism this is your man - Chucky the Clown. Add 'Build the Wall' and you have #Trump #MAGA
thats Raycissssss.....
Stealing @realDonaldTrump ideas and passing them off as your own. Democrats have no vision. 
Plagiarism might as well add in #MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp  Dems have no ideas now copying Trump. 
Ripping off @realDonaldTrump s platform will NOT help you...you DO realize that...right? #ThereCanBeOnlyOne #TrumpsTheMan #MAGA
Just killing the US letting 45 & family get richer while in office. Take power from 45 til you find the truth. Deep pockets must go.
To late that is Trumps plan. Can't dems come up with anything on their own.
Stop stealing Ideas from our President.
Is this one of the 6 ways to Sunday plans?  I don't think it's going to work.
"and more"...in case Trump comes up with more ideas that we can claim as our own! 
Bet it’s never once occurred 2 you that companies o/s and ship jobs overseas because of our current tax rates. Your solution is MORE TAXES..
Sorry, Trump is already doing this.  Need to get your own ideas.

Hey, that's a nice TRUMP policy you have there Chuck. Plagiarize much? 
I did not realize @SenShumer was a Trumpster??!!  @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump
Welcome to the @realDonaldTrump  train @SenSchumer . But at least cite your sources. Don't be like @CNN . You clearly got this from The Don.
WaitWhaatTrump already detailed all this a year ago and has been implementing this for months. Have you not been paying attention Chuck?
Sounds really familiar...oh yeah, #MAGA
hahaha..demokratski lopovi ukradli program Trumpu..
This is why we voted @realDonaldTrump  into office, this iis his vision, You can show your support to the people & the agenda we voted for
This is the same thing our President ran on during the election.  Can't you think of anything original?
Chuckie, you wouldn't know a better deal if......
First, you copy Papa John's slogan and now you're copying President Trump's agenda.  Come up with something of your own!!
So, in other words, Trump's platform. #plagiarism #copycat
So I would assume that you are going to be passing out blue hats that say "Make America Great Again" or something along those lines.  LOL
Copy/Paste of Pres. Trump's agenda ha ha ha.  Support POTUS Trump then!
That is exactly what President Trump has been advocating for two years. However, you called him an extremist radical for suggesting them.
The WV governor has converted to Trump, I guess thieving Chuck sees that the Trump Train is the only way to go.
Brazenly plagiarizing MAGAnomics, I see. Worse still is the fact that your comrade disciples are too doltish or morally bankrupt to care.
Democratic leaders are being exsposed daily 4 the corrupt shills that they are.Any bill or advise they produce is 2 only line their pockets
Lmao @ chucky
Gee,Trump hasn't moved to do single one of these things, pardoned China,no prosecutor appointment or proposal.Democrats only real Americans!
Needs more meat but a good start.
Sorry STEALING PRESIDENT TRUMPS IDEAS will not help the DEMOCRATS
We don't need a d al, or another scam to get votes. Just leave us alone.
Where's my single payer?
#ABrokenDeal is Dems killing American middle class by flooding us w/ low skill illegal aliens and negotiating TPP to destroy any jobs left
GO LEFT, IDIOTS
This is garbage, and as a progressive I'm desperately disappointed by it. This is Trump's platform. Why can't we talk about what matters?
So you've  seen the light and become a Trump supporter too? Wonderful!
Your Social programs funded by draining every last drop of blood from hard working taxpayers for your #ABetterDeal freeloaders is BS #MAGA
No.
Protectionism is wrong and anti-consumer.
How can @POTUS be wrong and evil on everything if you're copying him 100% You think people are that dumb?
What a joke.
No person that voted for @realDonaldTrump believes anything u say. You're wasting your time. We ALL see right through this shame. #pathetic
It is amazing how pathetic liberals like U are Chuck. The fake Russia thing didn't work out so you resort to using Trumps agenda as your own
What is even more funny r the people/sheep that liked this comment. GOT NEWS FOR U, @realDonaldTrump said ALL of these things 12 months ago
When Democrats need to learn how to win again, they simply use all the promises that got @realDonaldTrump elected.
LOL!!! Democrats are so desperate to gain any sort of power that you literally try to pass off EVERYTHING Trump ran on as your own.
How about doing some research and interacting with your base? You are advocating Republican views because you think that will get you votes!
The #Trump words, statements and actions, with the word 'better'
That's whose plan? USA USA #TRUMP

#Demswant #SHARIAand abortions
Wait is this a joke?
HEY TRUMP WON OVER IGNORANCE AND CORRUPT SCAM SCHUMER
It had to take a shellacking at the polls for you to get aboard the Trump train? Now quit the foolish Resistance and help Trump MAGA!
Very Trumpian...Ams see thru Dem BS. U put more out of workforce and on welfare in 8yrs. Worst since Great Depression
So now we're appropriating @realDonaldTrump economic idiocy, and only condemning his social idiocy?
you're useless! you couldnt do this stuff before and you wont do it now. you never will because you're totally out of touch with americans.
thats fine and all but how about we make america competitive on the world stage to bring companies here. you'll rail against the 1% instead!
Sounds like Make America Great Again with extra steps.  Literally plagiarizing Trump's campaign promises he is fulfilling.
We already voted for the man that's doing just that. As usual, you're late to the party.
Ah so literally the point of MAGA
Great Ad!!! Something missing: simple, clear explanation (could be sectioned in items each explained with short worded examples). Forge ahea
hahaha, you got destroyed by trump and now your only option is to copy him. pathetic.
What about immigration? What does the new Democratic platform say about it?
A better deal .. from the Demorrhoid Party? ... Should be named SHAFTA
October 1st health care premiums come out! The hike will be huge and Obamacare will implode! No help from the President! 
Damn Chuck seams I heard that somewhere before oh yeah TRUMP MAGA Your party is DEAD
First. Arrest obama for treason, Hillary for murder!
No deal with democrats on anything!
Sorry chucky-boy this is #MAGA . Nice try....did you cheat on tests in school as well?
Soooo,  you're stealing Trumps platform and calling it your own... got it thx

Chuckles,you hade 8 years of glory with Obama an Crooked Hillary,now you want to work!! why don´t you try all working together for people..
Did you copy our @POTUS... shame on the Dems still unable to come up with an idea
More originality from the left. Plagiarists.
Welcome aboard @SenSchumer ! #MAGA
You mean #letsmakeamericagreatagain
This is literally Trump's economic plan
Wow you had lunch with the Donald. Chucky S. has not had original thought since Moby Dick was a minnow.
My God; you sound just like Trump 45!  Plagiarism is the sincerity form of flattery!
You liking @realDonaldTrump plans now Chuck?  How about coming up with your own ideas? #ABetterDeal
So you agree with POTUS Mr. Schumer?
Chucky has jumped on the Trump.    hahaha
Keep trying to push this crap agenda. Democrats will lose more government positions because it is the party of immorality and greed
guys I have a good slogan for you! Let's make America even greater! I swear it's nothing like trumps! I'm sure the dumb plebs won't notice
We know that the congress critters dont actually write their tweets...but u ppl that do are part of the problem too.
Thats everything that Trump said from day one....dummy.
Why are you all obstructing @POTUS then b/c he is doing exactly that. He is putting in place better trade deals for America. Confused 
You think you can be trusted? You are trying to impeach @POTUS with false accusations to save the skins of the criminals in your party.
That's literally every single thing @realDonaldTrump ran on that you crowed was horrible...... #Hypocrite
Are you seriously trying to run on our @POTUS platform?? You have lost your ever living mind, Chucky....smdh
good that you are now on the trump train cuck schumer
I think that was called #MakeAmericaGreatAgain wasn't it?
Trump 2020 Schumer hahaha
These are all @Potus Trump ideas you looney toon! He said all of these first-and We knew they were good when we elected him in november! 
screw your better deal crap your not fooling anyone with your lip service.. America 1st & MAGA is working and you hate it. Dems = liars.
No kidding Chuckie. You dopes should of thiught about that in 2016. Instead you and your party were ready for the coronation. Duhhhhhhh
Literally everything Trump campaigned on
Did you really just take Trump’s plan and claim it as your own? This has to be a joke.
Desperation sets in on democrats,  now using Trump agenda to try and win a couple votes. Too little too late. Years b4 democrats control.
you're a NUT.
This is what Trump is already doing, and you're attempting to steal the credit for his work!
#ABetterDeal
#Thief

Um...this is hilariously everything that Donald Trump campaigned on and is doing-sooo, why don't you guys pull up yur pants & work together?
Maybe tax corporations more just in general
We can't buy their crap if the roads fall apart
Sounds like Chucky has boarded the Trump Train... does this mean RESIST has ended and #ABetterDeal is code for advancing Trump agenda? #MAGA
Lolololololololol Can't you come up with your own ideas?
Your #BetterDeal is a loser, and so are you. #resignandreplace
Geezus, you #Dimms just cant stop #cheating or #stealing , it must be some Genetic Disorder
Wow Chuckles. You come up with that on your own? Looks mighty familiar. A "better deal" is you resigning.
sounds exactly what Trump ran on. welcome aboard the TrumpTrain Schumer
@SenSchumer #betterdeal give us a break. Retire and take @MaxineWaters and @NancyPelosi with you.
@ScottAdamsSays OH MY !!!!
Stop pretending you came up with this. This is Trumps plan. This is why we voted for Trump. Pay attention!
I know you think most of your dem party are stupid or brainwashed, & they are, but c'mon man, even the'll know you are regurgitating #HeeHaw
No Thanks @SenSchumer keep your #betterdeal
U literally copied Trump u sad man if this is what u want then u should support Trumps agenda period if not then ur lying
0.01 shekels have been deposited in your bank account, oy vey!
Thanks so much for adopting Trumps agenda, it will be great for America and the democrat party. MAGA @POTUS
