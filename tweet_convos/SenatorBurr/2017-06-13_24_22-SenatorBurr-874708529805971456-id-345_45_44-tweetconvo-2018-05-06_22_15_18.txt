The way Burr let Sessions stonewall, while reprimanding Senator Harris for asking Sessions about the exact policy he is quoting is appalling
Dem idiots all insisting potus told Holt that he fired comey due to Russia invest! He DID NOT say that in any way! Watch the damn interview!
Guy, you need to quit interrupting #California's @SenKamalaHarris. You don't interrupt male senators. Cut that shit out. #SessionsHearing
It's disgraceful & he's done it 2 hearings that I've seen. Sessions was intentionally using up her time.
Also @SenJohnMcCain, a NON-MEMBER w/ less of a right to speak at this hearing than she, an actual member, interrupted her as well. Shameful.
Agreed. Keep McCain out if he can't keep his mouth shut. Oh, I forgot, he sold his soul again so his wife got her job. Shame on him.
SORRY - I MEANT "WAY TO GRILL HIM, DICK!" - NO QUESTION MARK
S
Squash this nonsense!  America needs to move on from this Russia conspiracy
The entire professional US intelligence and national security apparatus strongly disagree. If innocent, why won't he take that seriously?
And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you...
So you don't trust the men and women who have dedicated their lives and careers to defend this country?
Not the Obama leftovers, they have agendas.  And yes I do support the men and women that defend.. I'm married to a career Navy man!
Brit Hume said you acted like a potted plant while Sessions was being interrupted.  Lol. Great.
Senate insists Potus claimed to Lester holt on tv that he fired Comey due to Russia invest! This is a lie! He did NOT say that in any way!
We the American people demand you republicans grow a backbone and push a special counsel/hearing on Loretta lynch immediately!
When are you going to Subpoena former AG Lynch?
Great grilling one of the few decent and honorable persons in that entire room.
AG Jeff Sessions made you & every other Witch Hunter on your Intel committee look like Deep State spies for the Obama/Clinton/Lynch cabal!
Please stand up for the country over the private interests of Sessions and Trump and either force him to answer or invoke the 5th. #usa
So Sessions can just refuse to answer questions because he doesn't want to--gotcha. Why are you wasting taxpayers' money on this fake inves?
You are need in Carolina to clean up Mental Health Services
Please don't let him get away w/not answering ?'s under oath w/out legal standing. Thats Dangerous Precedent & can ruin your credibility
No he isn't.(Justice Dept&FBI-executive)serve at the pleasure of Presidentseparation of powersthat's legislature,judicial,executive
Don't listen to this dope out here trying to educate. U r exactly right that the FBI and justice dept is meant to be independent.
FBI only investigates,Justice decides to try & president can tell them to stop anything he wants. Guess haven't listen 2 Allen Dershowitz
Don't care abt him, set for life & so is familyhow abt you

you treated Sessions better than you did Harris, very rude and disrespectful

My legal team is still waiting for a reply from US Special Counsel Mueller.
Why is it that Senator Harris is the only one interrupted?
Or, Sessions offers committee members a tray of Keebler E.L. Fudge Double Stuffed  Elfwich cookies
He was not being as forthcoming as he could. He only answered questions that he had "good" answers for.
You need to #InvestigatingKamalaHarris in attendance and knowledge of #ContractWithNaziPartyBDSMEFLMedicalGroup #RemoteNeuralMonitoringMindC
@KamalaHarris She's the one directing the ?'s in an allotted time so she decides when the answer is sufficient to move on.
The only way the American People will get REAL oversight of the Trump administration is to give the Dems control of Congress in 2018.
Treatment of Sen. Harris was shameful! You do not do that to males. You white men do not reflect, nor do you represent America.
@KamalaHarris Is it b/c she's a woman? Or you didn't like your buddy squirming in the hot seat? You did it w/Rogers & Coates too. Apologize!
You owe @KamalaHarris an apology. You've called her out twice now, nobody else, & you know Sessions was intentionally wasting  her time.
Well wasn't that a lovely ending speech you gave. Thanking his wife, etc. He answered NOTHING!!! This hearing was a waste of time.
Why have I seen you call out Senator Harris 2 hearings in a row like a child? And it's only when it's people you're trying to defend. Why?
As chairman, can you direct the other senators to stop interrupting and allow Mr Sessions to answer.
Only if it's a woman.
Ur deferential demeanor toward Sessions went beyond respectful, esp when u admonished Harris, then exchanged pleasantries w/ witness. Not OK
Why did you not hold AG in contempt?  I can appreciate allowing him to answer q's by asking Harris to slow, but to silence her? Ashamed ctzn
Thanks for defending the frail A.G. From the powerful @KamalaHarris. It's embarrassing to watch weak men publicly humiliate themselves!
Reprimanding @SenKamalaHarris says racism and sexism. You've never reprimanded the men on the committee for doing what she did. Why not?


Senator, what is the problem between you and Senator Harris?
A waste of time to continue hearings if your not forceful in getting answers that aren't classified. Just putting on a show that looks dum..
In contempt for refusing to answer questions. Unfair  that in closed sessions the ppl don't get to hear answers that should be in the open..
Sen Burr it seems to be a waste of time on these hearings when the members only have 5 min for questions and Your not even holding people..
continued shut down of Kamala ONLY what's up with that????
As Session's lied you interrupted Kamala Harris, aren't you supposed to be on the same team!  You are an embarrasment!  The GOP will go down
WHEN IS THE HEARINGS FOR #LorettaLynch #Comey leaking ??????
You need to do a better job! America is watching what you are doing with this investigation. You barely win re-election. Country first!!
In future hearings when McCain is there, your remarks should include telling him to stop harassing Kamala Harris!
Racist bigot sexist misogynist PUTIN PUPPET
You and McCain don't have anything to do but be rude to Black woman racist bigot
I going to tell you the same thing I told McCain. If you can't handle strong, smart women, stay home and pull the covers over your head.
Please protect our democracy. Please.
Stop being so rude and misogynist....you have a problem with smart women of color?
You let @SenJohnMcCain make that long senile rant, but @SenKamalaHarris can't ask a question??
When are u getting rid of Mueller? When r u going to set the agenda instead of the Democrats? Disgusted w the Republicans lack of leadership
Senator Burr where is your spine? Are you going to let this administration get away with this?
WATCH what GOP did in the #Clinton investigation when witnesses refused to answer questions but didn’t assert exec. priv. #SessionsHearing 
Apples and oranges.  Video is about classified info which congress has a right to.  They don't have a right to presidential communication.
Its been a week and no call for L Lynch Investigation? What are you waiting for? Comey admitted OBSTRUCTION from Lynch! Will you do nothing?
Sir, I urge you as an American to put country before party. Please stop allowing the blatant filibuster to continue. We deserve answers.
What is wrong with you Republicans.  No collusion. No obstruction.  When will you subpoena Lynch, Clinton and Rice!? Stop this scam!
And when you say, "prepared remarks..." do you mean before, or after. Please clarify, the whole charade seemed pretty rehearsed.
Thank you for making apparent the inherent misogyny and chauvinism of the ol'white boys club aka GOP. Sadly, no shaming the shameless.
U r single handedly "codifying" perverse extension of Executive Privilege. "I'm preserving his right to claim EP" = Ex-Speculative Privilege
The kind of questioning of AG Sessions today was shameful. You should NOT ALLOW lack of respect going like that!
STOP THESE EFFING HEARINGS NOW!!!  We are SICK of this BS and we WILL not forget what you've done to America in the next election!!!
Subpoena Obama to find out why he didn't start investigating Russia until after election. He was in charge
Many of us didn't appreciate your repeated condemnation of Sen. Harris for interrupting. No such rebuke for male senators, eg. Sen. Warner!
Wow, really asked Sessions the tough questions, huh Burr? At the end, I thought you were gonna hope in his lap and cuddle.
You do not interrupt male senators. Don't impose a double standard for @SenKamalaHarris, it's flat out misogynistic.
Nonsense, should of told everyone to produce some results for us citizens, waste of time and resources.
I appreciate your leadership and integrity during these hearings, but please stop interrupting the only woman of color on this committee.
This Committee's investigation is the biggest waste of our tax payers money. What is wrong with Washington. @TomCottonAR bravo !
THE HILLARY CASE NEEDS TO B REOPENED!!SHE NEEDS TO B PROSECUTED!!
Awwww, what's the matter, women of color got you down?
I sincerely hope as a resident of NC you start representing your district better. You're a Rep. STAND BY OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP! Or next ....
HARRIS WAS BEING A RUDE WITCH TO SESSIONS.WE DO NOT ALLOW THAT.PERIOD!!
You opened and said AG must answer questions, but he didn't. Now what?!
WE DEMAND LORETTA LYNCH B INVESTIGATED.SHE IS THE ONE THAT OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.WE DEMAND JUSTICE NOW!!WE R SICK OF U REP NOT DEFENDING PRES T
Whether you like it or not, Senator Harris is your equal. How dare you interrupt her
U spoke to Rogers yesterday, have u spoken to HIS cohort cap n crunch yet? Or does the cryptkeeper get a pass too?
Lil gomer needs to resign!he lied right out of the box& he lied today,WHY ARE WE PRETENDING?why is lil gomer GETTING ANOTHER GODDAMN PASS?
So what did u thank Sessions FOR?his 12 "I don't recall"s or his 13"I don't want 2 talk about my talks w/prez".HE IS SUPPOSED 2 ANSWER U!
YOU ARE A COWARD--we the people want to see you shut this reality show down. Letting Democrats run rough shot is not what we are looking for
NO on ACHA 24 million will lose healthcare including seniors, children , disabled persons and you will lose your senate seat!
Your conduct today against Senator Harris was unjust, and she deserves an apology.
SHE DOES NOT.SHE WAS RUDE TO SESSIONS.THEY ALL OWE SESSIONS AND PRES TRUMP AN APOLOGY!!
Since you lack the will to get in the heart of questioning and the balls to challenge let @SenKamalaHarris do it! Stop interrupting her!
She is highly qualified to question and demand answers. What do you fear what will be exposed? Collusion with Russia?
You interrupted Sen. Kamala Harris during that session. A disrespectful, cowardly thing to do.
Disgusting and Shameful how you treat Senator Harris!  Sexist misogynist I feel sorry for the people that voted for you.  #shameful #sad
Quit interrupting @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris.
Why do you keep interrupting @SenKamalaHarris ? Do you just hate her or all strong women? You should be ashamed.
I am disgusted with your treatment of Senator Harris. Let her do her job. Sessions was waffling and wasting her time. You are a mysoginist
Sessions made this committee look like a joke.  Refusing to answer your questions and you all let him get away with it. It's disheartening.
Why are you so willing to let the Russians & Trump get away with tampering with our elections? Is your plan to turn Russia into our friend?
Hope voters remember that you let Sessions get away with having no memory, no legal reason not to answer, while you shut Kamala down - again
Would be wise to treat all senators equally. Not how you treated Sen Harris today. Your misogyny is showing. Get over yourself.
Your party appears to be traitors to our democracy.  You are choosing party over country. A wave of fury will sweep you out of office.

Quit cutting Senator Harris off!
Sessions was certainly stonewalling! I worry that he forgets and gets nervous when a bright lady speaks!
Ur bias for ur good ol' boy Beauregard and contempt and disrespect for @KamalaHarris is obvious. #Deplorable #SessionsHearing
@realDonaldTrump @senburr Senator Harris a disgrace and needs to be fired from committee. What's next throwing shoes at eachother.
You should have cut off Senator Harris before she went as far as she did.  The people do not want to see our officials degrading eachother
Fire Kamala from committee.  She does not have the composure or demeanor required to serve on such a prestigious committee.
@SenatorBurr the AG made a jackass out of you and your committee today. "Nope, not gonna answer. Nope not gonna invoke. Nothing u can do."
You should dismiss Kamala Harris from committee.  I found her tone and temper wholly disrespectful for a former senator and current AG.
Let @KamalaHarris do her job. California wants the truth, not that good ole boy bs you want hear.
We deserve answers. Please subpoena A.G. Sessions to testify again so issue of executive privilege can be resolved. It is your duty.
Never Forget 

Burr Supports Trump:

 Obstructing Justice
 Kicking 23 MILLION off Health Care
 Praising Dictators who MURDER Citizens
Stop interuppting Senator Harris!
You are either intentionally impeding or you just don't care enough to get the truth one is illegal the other disgraceful .recuse or quit!
Thank you sir.
Blatantly sexist and racist behavior @SenatorBurr to so rudely and repeatedly interrupt Sen Harris. "Devin Nunes"
Considering your position do you think it's wise to call an investigation A witch hunt? It screams "I'm not doing my Job " because 1/
Dear Sir, today should be the end of this investigation concerning POTUS and his team. Tax payers have had enough, As chairman call for end.
Of course that would make the great and wonderful leader of GOP mad and we don't want that.Never mind you are shirking your duty to country.
Hey @SenatorBurr I'm inviting you to my home. Lets talk about this. Alamance county. We'll fix dinner. You're out of session August right?
As the chairman call for a vote, or give 2 weeks to find some evidence of those that have been placed under scrutiny. Thank you Sir.

.@Bakari_Sellers on Sessions' hearing: "He never was briefed about Russian interference and can care less"
Dear Sir, we Americans know Russia hacked tried to influence in some way the election, Maybe more so Assange agenda Time to end this
You're a gutless coward, and @SenKamalaHarris was way above and more courageous than you will ever be.
Ok, I was totally talking you up. Until today. Your closing statements might as well have been bukake. Make him answer the questions Burr.
Why did you & McCain double team Kamala Harris & allow Sessions to filibuster her question?  Your partisan is showing, Burr. Caught you.
https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/874790256742195200 … this is what #burrnothingtoseehere calls Sessions answering questions
"I don't recall" was a common response from AG Sessions during Tuesday's testimony — and committee members noticed. 
It's time to shut this ridiculous smear fest down.  The @GOP is done with it.
Burr follow the dam money oh you can't your hey what about the 1.25 million you got from russia??????
Sir disappointed tells us how much money is paying you oh we know 1.25 million pac you sir you're not protecting the country recuse truth ..
You need to lay off @SenKamalaHarris, this is a smart woman and if you'd shut up and listen maybe you could learn how to question a witness.
If you have another committee meeting, how about the Republikons asking some relevant questions rather than shielding for Trump.
Why would you need to prepare remarks for Sessions? He's a big boy, shouldn't he of prepared his own remarks!!!
Women are watching you. We vote in greater numbers than men. We also contribute to opponents.  Just so you know.
Get'm... don't just vote them out their jobs.. run and take their seats..
Why won't you let @SenKamalaHarris speak? This was the 2nd hearing you shut her down.
#Cuck
Trump should order Rosenstein to fire Mueller- you senators are full of yourselves with this investigation! Pardon Flynn and be done!

Why do u continue to disrupt harris when she speaks? #misogyny
U need to STOP being a misogynistic "good ol boy" towards @KamalaHarris-we the American ppl SEE YOU & your antics towards her & not others!
Why didn't you hold Jeff's hand since that mean old Sen. Harris made him so nervous with hard questions. Like the AG, you are paper thin.
Why do you have senators from the same state on committee.  Should make a rule against that@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Harris-embarrassment
Nice game of softball. Too bad he couldn't sit on your lap, so he wouldn't be so cotton mouthed nervous.
I had hope for this committee but I now see it is simply party over a country , there is no over site in this congress
Call AG Sessions again, please. The legality of his "Executive Communication Procedure" is not visible ANYWHERE.
It would be nice if you could be more courteous to Senator Kamala Harris during these hearings.
@jeffsessions is an honest, patriotic man who should never have been subjected to this nonsense! @SenTomCotton spoke what we are feeling!
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @SenatorLankford @SenTomCotton @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept

Shame on you Mr. Burr,chastising Senator Harris for trying to get to the truth, shame on you!!
Senator Burr is my NC Senator and not worth the powder to blow him up, as we say in NC.
And put the evidence of crimes up or shut this shit show down. What a joke!!!
Lets hear testimony on Obama domestic surveillance and actions taken by Obama to protect us from Russia? Why did Dems block arming Ukraine?
Burr showed his contempt for the truth by allowing Session to avoid answers but calls out Sen Harris for asking questions. A betrayal of US
have not heard such a poor memory since Sam Ervin was doing the asking. The AG was an embarrassment.
If you want justice and the truth you have to let @SenKamalaHarris get to it.  Otherwise, you just protect the corruption and the Russians.
You are not as smart, nor as wise as @SenKamalaHarris and you don't represent nearly the population.  Shouldn't you cede your time to her.
Take advise from your ancestor: "talk less, smile more"-Aaron Burr
Sir can u tell me why r dems out for blood why is this not a fair investigation. i know that is how u form panel, this is not good for USA
why must you continue to cut off @SenKamalaHarris ?

@SenatorBurr to @PatMcCroryNC: 
Hold my beer. I'm going to eff  up & save your name. I'll be infamous, I mean famous. https://twitter.com/funder/status/871509715985072128 …
Do you feel like a man when you interrupt women?  That's twice now.  What are you trying to tell us?
You suck Burr.
Sessions memory needs to be checked he may have dementia!
What are you going to do about AG Sessions refusal to answer your committees questions @SenToomey @SenBobCasey the ppl want answers
Wah! Harris is actually doing her job-time for insecure Burr to interrupt. You are a weakling. Pathetic behavior. 
True leader cares about all of Americans
Youve been running the investigation in a glaringly biased fashion, even worse than Nunes. You seem to be making sure admin never answers ?s
shame on you for interrupting @KamalaHarris not once but twice. Are you intimidated by WOMEN with  intellect & power? #Equality
With all due respect, we were DUPED & so were you! If there is nothing to hide like @POTUS tapes- then one would just answer the questions!
He didn't answer any questions. I wish you were more committed to the truth than your party.
You irreparably damaged Congressional oversight of the Executive today. But Hey, it was for a RINO prez. Congrats! #Burr #SessionsHearing
Doesn't Congress have oversight responsibilities? Why do govt officials refuse (w/no legal basis) to answer? Congress appears weak/useless.
You and @SenJohnMcCain obviously have issues with people who possess brown skin and vaginas. #SexistPigs
YOU are a &^%$for the way you spoke to @SenKamalaHarris Learn some respect.
I would tell you what I thought of the testimony but it might "not be appropriate ". Remember when people used to respect Congress?
Who do you work for??? America??? Hard to tell! Why are you defending & looking to excuse Russia from harming our democracy?
Trump made the decision to not give the Executive Privilege  to Sessions. That means he decided Sessions should answer all conversations. ?
Why did u rudely cut off @KamalaHarris then let Sessions filibuster not answering questions but let @SenTomCotton make a mockery of hearing?
