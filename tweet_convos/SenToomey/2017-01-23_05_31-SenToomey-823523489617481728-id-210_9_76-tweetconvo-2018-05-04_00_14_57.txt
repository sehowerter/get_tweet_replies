why didn't you pay your constituents by voting no to DeVos? Our children deserve better!
Because gerrymandering is very effective so why bother? #DeVos
very true. Gerrymandering is a key issue people need to wake up to! Thanks
not worried about refugees coming to this country to harm my children DeVos as Sec of Ed will do that
That's a terrible thing to have to fear. Kids are too important to mess with. Toxic administration.
we do not need people like you rooting for the Steelers
IS THIS REALLY WHATS ON YOUR MIND WHILE YOUR STATE SUFFERS JOB LOSS? How was Palm Springs?
spend some time with @SenWarren so you can learn something about ethics, education and how to improve this country.
@sSenWarren  So glad you have time for this while immigrants are banned and you are not voting NO on ALL nominations.
do u honestly think this is important right now? Answer ur phone. Unlock your door to concerned constituents. Grow a spine.
You can pick up a free beer when ur with ur Koch Sugar Daddy!
she can't stand you. You are using her name here to validate yourself. Shameless
.@SenToomey @steelers @SenWarren @PennBrewery real patriots act like people died for the ideals of our country. #NoBanNoWall #freedom #usa
now please for the love of God pay your debt to your public and VOTE NO ON DEVOS
how about a No vote on DeVos instead?
Educators across the country have Betsy DeVos's number.  Do what's right for our kids and #DumpDevos
great photo opp. Now stand with her on education and vote against Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.  #StopDeVos
how about with voting no on Devos???
#DumpDevos #Guns4Grizzlies #GrowthOrProficiency #WhatIsIDEA
Please pay your debt w/ an act of courage for our country! NO to Devos! PA schools need help, not harm!
maybe have beers & tell @SenWarren how you duck your constituents but have time to check sportball scores
yep like oh what's this a form letter in response to one of my postcards let me just put it where it belongs thanks @SenToomey
Seriously? This is the garbage you post about? But you can't take calls or respond to emails about #dumpdevos. #priorities
Remember your yes vote for DeVos is what ended you're political career!!! Drink that power over people man!!
How about you pay your debt to her by listening to your constituents and/or having a spine
please do the right thing and vote against Betsy DeVos as as Education Secretary.
so with this coup going on your taliikibg about football! Listen to your msgs we are still calling no hiding town hall toast
Re: important matters DeVos has proven unfit. Don't vote your campaign coffers.
how about you listen to what Senator Warren has to say
do your job honestly and forget about sports.
Wait- Senator - you are in Palm Springs, and completely silent on the immigration matter? Please chime in on this.  We need your moral help!
OMG seriously!  America is burning - set alight by an infantile madman and this is what you tweet???   DO SOMETHING - SAVE US FROM TRUMP!
Anything else u'd like to talk about? I don't think @SenWarren cares about ur bet right now. She has more important things to do
worry about the unrest in our country 
has time to tweet trivialities about @steelers with @SenWarren. Do you have nothing to say about #MuslimBan? You have no shame.
glad you have time for leisure activities. Stand up for what is right. Did you vote for president bannon? Speak out!!!
r u still mourning steelers' loss from a week ago? i'd love to hear your opinion on #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall please!
THIS is what's on your mind? Do not repeal the ACA!
.@SenToomey @SenWarren you seem to be silent on the ban that is being felt at international airports. Statement, sir?
no more football until you start answering your constituents.
and by work, I mean opposing our new dictator.
Luckily, she's a better senator than you. Hopefully she had a beer after last night.
You only won by 100k votes- over 3 million people didn't vote for you- PA is watching you and you're hanging by a thread.
How about you get off twitter and do SOMETHING?!?!?  This country is in crisis and you're tweeting about a freaking football game
yinz know in yer heart dat DeVos is unqualified to head this department. Please so the right thing. PA needs you to #DumpDevos
I'm glad you care more about football than families being torn apart and refugees being denied safe haven. #NoBanNoWall
Less time on sports and more on your job. Stop confirming incompetents, fight for affordable care 4 all, be a hero, not a lackey.
we don't want to hear about football! where do you stand on this outrageous immigration ban?
pay your debt to her by standing up to the tyranny coming out of the White House!!!
you are concerned about a football game when America is being destroyed? #MuslimBan
Be accountable to the people you represent. We deserve answers from you.
really - all that is going on and we get a sports tweet. Smh
Join @SenWarren and vote against #BetsyDeVos
please no on ed sec nominee Betsy DeVos - save our kids
Casey is giving us important info while you tweet about football
RIGHT?! Bread & circuses over here
Hmmmm What would be better than a beer? A Vote No on Devos
vote NO to Betsy Devos!
We need a town hall meeting so you can more effectively represent your constituents.
You must agree with the White House lies because I haven't heard your statement denouncing it. Is this true?
Vote No to @BetsyDeVos...put a stop to #KeystoneXL and #DAPL
.@SenToomey @steelers .@SenWarren @PennBrewery  VOTE AGAINST Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.
Jeez, @SenToomey, we have a @POTUS who lies & whose crappy Cabinet appointments you defend & you're posting jaunty tweets about @steelers?
how can you talk about sports when there are major issues in our county
hear you are undecided about @BetsyDeVos. Do NOT confirm: she is a threat to our children's education in state of PA & elsewhere.
will you pay your debt to your constituents?  No to DeVos.
vote NO on Devos. Our schools are suffering enough with budget cuts.. we do not need someone who has no experience as secretary!
Less time with Twitter- #answeryourphone - Your constituents are calling!
With all the crap going on in this country- you have time to tweet about this??
Thanks for comparing my 2 time cancer surv. dad a burnt down house.  He's worked harder in 75 yrs. than you ever will. @SenWarren
how about instead you pay your debt to your constituents and DO YOUR JOB? A meeting would be nice. Or people answering your phone
stop running away from your constituents about the ACA repeal.     No one wants it repealed stop running
why don't you tweet about real issues and how you hide from us #TuesdayswithToomey
...maybe you could explain how you think it's appropriate to compare human beings to burnt out buildings.
Instead of tweeting about football and beer...
How do you have time to watch sports, but can't meet with your constituents re: #DeVosconfirmation #SaveACA?
Not looking good on twitter. We will vote U out faster than u can say midterm if you and peers don't control the DT wackjob!
"game" that counts: Repealing/replace ACA | Kaiser Family Foundation
You'd better start working for us real soon!
you are in the process of dismantling health care putting anti Medicare person in Cabinet, and this is your concern
- @SenBobCasey is getting work done! You do know your constituents can see you right?
We are not burnt houses. We are humans! We deserve the same healthcare you receive! Let's take away your Viagra!
People with pre-existing conditions are a "burnt down house", Senator? You suck cock with a mouth like that?
Our public education system is about to fail as we know it, and you are tweeting about football. VOTE AGAINST @BetsyDeVos instead
VOTE NO on Devos.  She is grossly unqualified.  Be a man of honor not a puppet for Donald
Football season is done here. Stop Donald Trumps craziness now! Speak out! I'm counting on you as MY SENATOR
DO NOT REPEAL THE ACA I AM NOT A BURNED OUT HOUSE! #burneddownhouse #burnedouthouse
you can only think of football but keep your phone line closed? You work for us. Do your job.
You are such a disappointment. You have shown no independence from the Party. You do NOT represent Pennsylvania.
I wish you cared more about the censorship the President is applying to science than football. #climate
how bout pay debt to Pa voters by voting for constituents and not party only.
HR 7 attacks women and your voicemail is full so god damn it I'm wasting my first tweet on you
Don't be a #RubberStamp #TuesdayswithToomey All across #Pennsylvania
go ahead keep backing this trump disaster. You will lose your job.I will c to that!
We don't hear your voice against Trump!  You promised to be a 'check' on Trump. Take a stand for the American people.
Who cares about football when your party is dismantling healthcare for all Americans
Whom gives a damn about the Steelers. Do your damn job, #Iamwatchingyou
Toomey, 
Why have you ignored the largest women's march on world history?
How do you do that?
I'm thinking you must agree with the lies from the White House. Haven't heard otherwise.... Is this ok with you?
how about you hold a town hall mtg in Philly. Haven't seen you since 2013
how about you worry more about the disaster you're supporting for the Dept of Ed
3 million illegal votes
how do you guys keep a straight face
what are you going to do about the 3 million votes Trump said were illegal.
Why are you talking about football when the GOP is trying to repeal the ACA?! I am a PA voter, do not repeal the ACA!
Now that that's over, I hope you've had a chance to read PA Budget & Policy Center's ACA report. https://pennbpc.org/sites/pennbpc.org/files/Impact_of_ACA_Repeal_Final.pdf …
I hope @SenWarren doesn't rebuff your offer and call u a burnt down house, @SenToomey. Owner Occupant? Your lack of integrity violates code.
repay the debt to @SenWarren by defending the ACA. Constituents want more than beer from your office.
So where is this secret Republican retreat your going to on Thursday with POTUS?
it's so upsetting to see your carefree tweets about the game when I am worried sick about losing my EXCELLENT coverage under #ACA
less talk about beer and more about voting no to DeVos. As the @Patriots say, #DoYourJob. #DumpDevos
.@SenToomey idk @SenWarren probably just wants you to stop the #KeystoneXL and fight for the #ACA instead of a beer
YOU OWE ELIZABETH WARREN MORE THAN THAT.  You and your whole party are corporate greedy liars
senator PLEASE #DumpDeVos for the sake of disabled students.
#StopDeVos Trump's pick for EDU Help us tell @SenToomey IN PHILLY @TuesdaysToomey https://www.facebook.com/events/1733155223680327 …
you don't have to! Just give her the #alternativefact that the Steelers won bigly. They had at least a million and a half points!
If you would buy @SenWarren a beer over football, please consider actually listening to her & working with her. I am a PA voter!
stop repaying beer debts and go vote no on DeVos, Price and Tillerson!
get to work & confirm the remaining cabinet nominees- stop democrat obstruction
If you think your buddy Tabun99 scares people away your wrong Sen Toomey.
no one gives a shit
get back in the kitchen and cook
tell Pocahontas to go back to the reservation
while you're having that pint with @SenWarren, maybe discuss how you're not going to repeal ACA.
no how they are going to repeal it
WTF you talking about?
you owe your constituents a debt. Start listening and oppose DeVos .
Good, maybe you will listen to @SenWarren , as she's the smartest Senator right now!
she is a clown, and ugly one at that
Vote NO on DeVos
vote yes!
no beer from the Choctaw nation?
the only thing @SenWarren wants is for you to keep us insured and for you to vote NO on these cabinet members #DoYourJob
too late!
NO to Scott Pruitt
yes to Scott Pruitt
many women from Pennsylvania at Women's March.  Do we count?
no
how about a reaction to the Women's March, acting as if it didn't happen.
I don't care about football. WHY IS YOUR VOICEMAIL STILL FULL. Your constituents don't want #BetsyDeVos
NO to Tillerson (Russian award winner), Devos, Pruitt. Save ACA. NO TO ROSS (RUSSIA AGAIN)
they are getting it
.@SenToomey @steelers @SenWarren Pat WE Don't care about football! It's issues: #ACARepeal, #Medicare #SocialSecurity. Where R U on THIS?!
please clear your phone so ur constituents can have a voice.
just go outside and scream
Before doing that -- take care of your constituents and SUPPORT the ACA.  We need that insurance!!!!!!
say bye bye!
better than getting screwed by HRC
. Please emergency relocated me to new home! Due to threaten suicide noted!
@FBI Oregon Senators don't fix everything for me @POTUS
.@SenToomey Dozens of replies from constituents here. None say "Repeal ACA" or "Please confirm [shitty cabinet pick]." #TuesdayswithToomey
.@sentoomey Please stop tweeting about sports & candy. Please stop ignoring constituents. Pls do your job. U work 4 us. #TuesdaysWithToomey
Please don't appeal ACA without a replacement that is better and cheaper.
Vote NO to Sessions
he has it you lost!
make sure you pay for it and not the taxpayers
it's coming out of your pocket balloon head
this amazing thing called the internet
You need to be focusing on your job. Vote no one DeVos and prevent Trump from destroying health coverage for PA residents
bye bye healthcare....
I am pretty sure @SenWarren would prefer a no vote for #DumpDevos or #pollutingPruitt to beer.
no one cares
Hi Carlos! I care and so does my family.
I doubt very much that you're very cute daughter cares
Thanks for the compliment!
what about your debt to your constituents to vote against DeVos?
she got the votes and will get the nomination
Alternative fact: Steelers won in tremendous victory. PERIOD.
Please use the opportunity to reassure her you will oppose Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary
she got the votes dipshit
vote no on Steve Mnuchin for Sec of Treasury also want to see Trumps taxes!
glad Steeler's made it to AFC game.  Go Pat's - on way to # 5.  #PatriotsNation
save our public schools from the blessedly ignorant Betsy DeVos.
say bye bye public schools
Now you can pay your debt to your constituents and oppose Trump's cabinet nominees
nope!
Instead of football why don't you find your own balls and STOP TRUMP?!
why he won?
Were you watching TV on Saturday?  Notice 500,000 people marching AGAINST YOU & TRUMP?
but he still won so the 500k didn't matter
how about paying her back by voting against Sessions Tillerson Pruitt and Devos. All unsuitable
Why don't you come meet with your voters? Have a town hall meeting. I'll bring beer
Forget the beer. Show up at your Philadelphia office on Tuesdays to hear their concerns.
how about next Saturday
Ought to send some Yuengling as well.
.@SenToomey a crucial moment in American history and you're tweeting about football? Is this real life?
football is more important
Penn Brewing & Steelers: Toomey threatens people's health care. What say YOU?
Why do you talk about beer while you jeopardize health coverage for 900,000 Pennsylvanians?
because nobody gives a shit
put that beer DOWN #DoYourJob oppose the billionaires taking over our Govt. #StopTillerson #StopDeVos #StopPruitt #StopPrice
can you pay your debt to your constituents by listening to us and what we value? #TuesdayswithToomey
no you lost
You're tweets are so irrelevant. What are you doing for PA and to keep our country and democracy safe?
no there not.
So football is relevant over policy and representative work on behalf of the constituents?
yes it is.  Get over yourself you are not that important
Football is irrelevant in the greater scheme of things and can't replace your lack of virility.
no not really, more people will watch the Super Bowl than any inaguration year after year.....
'There are other morons who rpioritize football over nat sec, climate change...' isn't much of an argument.
just stating numbers..& the avg person doesn't really care. As I said before get over yourself
When a cheater plays a rapist, the cheater always wins.
What's going on Pat? I put my vote behind u thnking smething was going to get done. Nominees?
vote yes!
Fuck the beer, listen and support her agenda for the American people, and call "alternative facts" what the are- LIES
