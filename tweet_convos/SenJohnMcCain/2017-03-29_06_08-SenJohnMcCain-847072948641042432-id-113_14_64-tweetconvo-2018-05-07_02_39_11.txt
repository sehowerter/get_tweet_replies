How about not bashing our legally elected POTUS. There are no russian ties.
There is no collusion according to spy agencies.
Tread lightly in the den of vipers, even a Lion, such as yourself, can be bit.
if you taxed the 1% you wouldn't have to cut funding for anything. Not that hard
Senator McCain I just saw your spot on the news. It seems like circling the wagons. Sad to say it. You're caving to the child in charge. SMH
Will you be discussing how bad you have sold out America you coward. #RINO
You lose your credibility by appearing on Fox (aka Fake) News.
Impeach Trump. Get rid of electoral college and give presidency to Clinton for the popular vote.
PLEASE try to knock some sense into them.
Your attempts to undermine @DevinNunes are shameful. The MSM is your constituency. #RINO #leaks
Hope you'll be discussing your impending RETIREMENT.
Not a chance. Time has passed you by.
keep fighting the good fight. Donald doesn't speak for all Republicans. You are a true hero.
No thanks. Not interested in anything you have to say. Heard it all before. Trump loves Russia etc.
You're speaking with Faux Noise? Oh excuse me Fox News. Hahahahaha
Please retire. U R embarrassing. U and lindsey didn't make the cut. Quit crying, and do your job.

Any chance you'll be announcing your resignation?? #MAGA
Thanks for your courage to hold Nunes accountable.. Please keep fighting against Russian influence!

You're a hero for us, and America loves you. That you cannot enforce the law upon the POTUS must be painful to you.

if you get your intelligent reports from NBC you're too damn stupid to be in Congress
more Trump Bashing? It's easy right John and gets you in TV weekly. You and Lindsey
Don't criticize Nunes, it appears he's one of the few that wants the whole truth and not a fable
Well, hallelujah, you threw @POTUS a bone on military. Should HRC Podesta be investigated 4 Russia?
Sounded like you were choking getting out just the most rudimentary complement.
Johnny the jet crasher falling from the sky again.This time spilling  fuel on some BS Russian hoax
earned a bit of respect back today. Failed Trump miserably so. Had my vote 1x. That changed
Had more evidence of you and the Keating 5 then Trump and Russia. Short memory
You are obsessed with Russia and Putin. How about what we do to Elections in other countries?
no one cares abt Paul manafort America wants jobs and wall not your Russian nonsense.
I am so disappointed with him. He is just not getting it anymore. He seems to be uninterested.
