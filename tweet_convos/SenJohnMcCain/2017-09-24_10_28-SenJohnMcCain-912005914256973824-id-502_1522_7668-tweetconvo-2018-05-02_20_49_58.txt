Thank you John for doing the POTUS' job.  45 is too ignorant to perform his elected duties.  Sad...
Even I didn't like McCain years before - nowadays, he's an hero in politics, Ed!!  🖒
Today he is an honorable statesman.
Correct, Ed! Sometimes, it's strange, how times are changing.....   


I have called and I encourage everyone to do the same, management of health care must go back to the states!
Healthcare is too important to go back to the states. You think it is complicated now? Graham-Cassidy would be an absolute disaster!!!
Shut up
Merkel is now the Leader of the Free World. Trump is the laughingstock of the Free World!
You care more about Germans than you do Americans.
Globalists like McCain want America to fail.
John you sir are a man of common sense.Your wisdom has a calming effect on our country. You to me will always be AN AMERICAN HERO. THANK YOU
I'm a democratic who has utmost respect for you because you put country before politics. As a 3 time cancer survivor myself, stay strong.
Such a relief. Such a relief.....
Why don't you switch parties, you are not a Republican. We pay too much for health care and much less coverage. You r in it for you not us.

That's interesting. McCain must be a Globalist/Left-leaning Democrat in disguise. Now, these photos make sense. 
Turning Right is turning upside down-  Senator McCain was, is, and will always be a Hero - thank you for your enduring service, Sen. McCain.
His support for Merkel shows that he is a globalist shitstain. War hero my ass he's a commie.
You are a Liar and a Traitor to your People enjoy that legacy!!!
Seems your a fan of her open border polices. I'm not surprised.
After 2015, she closed borders for all. Time, to reread actual news, not only Breitbart-shit.. 
You would congratulate her. Great job she's done destroying Germany.
Why why why can't you be president?
Mr McCain sorry for cancer, you need quit the Senate ASAP, maybe brain isn't thinking, before you ruin this country
You are helping the Democrats move this

 country to socialism sign Grahams bill.
Breitbart very strong internationally - note first time since war the part of the election that went for alt-right there, too. danger.
These people in support of McStain,are either clueless or Commies...
Delete your account.
As a lifetime Democrat, I've always liked you Mr. McCain.  God bless.
Thank you for staying strong! Please vote NO on this Healthcare bill!
Glad she got elected again. Experience, patience and leadership counts.
Amen to that
Strong indeed..
@northvike
Why do you care? You are now officially a Democrat
McCain is like a general pondering the facts while his troops wait on the battle field. @SenateGOP
You are a great statesman, Senator.
Did the president @realDonaldTrump knew there was election in Germany?
You MUST REPEAL OBAMACARE LIKE YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD
Thank you John for being a great person.
Resign.

Do you mean the Muslim alliance? #corruption God sees what you do Mr McCain, you will be accountable for your actions.
This is typical of John McCain he votes with everything the Democrats do, still pour looser. You lost John get over it, Ted Kennedy's buddy.
Go away Democrat leader
Thank You Senator McCain for your [non-support]  of Healthcare repeal.. Congratulations Angela Merkel..
As long as trump is in the WH that alliance is broken.
I agree! If you'll start Impeachment Proceedings, it will go a long way to help all global relationships! Please get well soon! We need you!
Please check out Dana Farber in Boston for their inputs you may be impressed !
Bob
And..Thanks Senator McCain for being so strong for our country at this critical time. Our prayers are with you for you to win this battle.
Now that we have a sad excuse for a president Angela Merkel is the one the free world looks up to.  She is a great leader!
Congratulations Angela 
Now if we can only keep them as allies as this so called Trump leader is alienating everyone & tweeting us into a war with N Korea. HELP
Of course you'd be celebrating the victory of a leftist party rather than the historic entry into the Bundestag of a right-wing party.
She is liberal like you.  You lie to the people of Arizona. You're a disgrace
U DISGUST ME RINO SONGBIRD. RESIGN
"We want to win back AFD voters by solving problems, by taking in their concerns &in part their fears & especially... good policy making."
EU has chosen not to pass Western Civ to future generations thru low birthrate Islam majority by 2050 U.S. Policy will change shortly
one of the most proff politic!
Really.. what is the point McCain?? Should not be a priority for you!! You need to go!!
You really think she is good for Germany?
Gruss Gott ich liebe Deutschland !
Be president just for a day
If you want to hold on to the alliance you better impeached tRump soon.
McCain is the hero. He deserves to be the president better than the clown  we have now. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Traitor McCain congratulates German dictator who is destroying Europe with Islamic immigrants.
They lost the votes and although the two parties combined are still large it will take months of wrangling before there is a government.
LOOK How ignorant liberals are when BO stopped our Coal mining Merkel was mining brown coal Dirtiest coal PARIS ACCORD SUCKED FOR THE U.S.A.
So true. We depend on Germany and Merkel to be the leader of the Free world now that Trump has abdicated the throne.
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA .. PLEASE RECALL JOHN McCain.. he lied to get elected.. he is a liberal democrat dressed as a RINO. DO IT FOR AMERICA.
LOOK JOHN.. all the liberals are backing you, you RINO.. I HOPE ARIZONA  RECALLS YOU FOR LYING TO THEIR FACES TO GET ELECTED.
JohnMcain will be gone soon enough.  I pray the People of Arizona RECALL YOUR RINO BUTT. you are a liberal democrat who lied to get elected.
You can kick rocks!
Rip germany ! Crooked Merkel ,selling Germany to saudi aribaia soon ! oh sad german have speak arabic,sharia law #ImpeachMerkel #impeachHer
You should come and visit germany to talk about our land. Germany is colourful, free and full of love! 
Of course you would be ok with this Globalist puke staying in power.
Ahab,  your revenge on the White Whale (Republican voters) because you never made president is obvious!  You will pass into obscurity! 
Did Obama make you tweet this?
I am so glad she won something about her makes me trust her  she is tough but honest that is what we need
Congratulations on your spreading brain rot. You will never be president LOLOLOL failure!
THANK YOU Senator McCain for your “steady hand” for the American People
Traitor McCain your legacy will reflect you screwing the Arizonains to spite @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @foxandfriends
https://youtu.be/zO0mHEJyC3Y 
I agree! Please stick to your principles on healthcare! The new revisions are even more terrible. You looked great on 60 mins. L'chaim!
Please don't let the GOP bribe your vote for the heath bill. Wording changed, still harmful bill. I will literally die if it passes.
Thank you from Germany. You were seen as one of a few rational thinking politicians in these crazy times. Keep going.
We need #Murkel 
in the world as the USA has the craziest #45on #WH
 We miss @POTUS44
 Congratulation to Germany from, Canada
#Saddays4USA
Merkel is critical to ISIS having a strong foothold in Germany. When the migration stops & ISIS heavily attacks Germany is doomed!
I am so glad Angela Merkel won. She is a leader with a level head.
Thank goodness.  Merkel is unequivocally the leader of the free world!
Only if you guys can do something to get rid of this fake POTUS. He's destroying everything good in this nation!
Yes she has really turned Germany into a great place ?
What about your alliance with democrats as you, a former POW hold Americans hostage with Obamacare?
Getting Trump out the WH is the best was for our alliances with any country
too bad Hillary didn't win......She could have made soo much more money without having to sell her book.  Need any more uranium Vladamir??
You could greatly help that by beginning the impeachment of Trump
Congratulations to the leader of the free world Angela Merkel
Globalists stick together
I'm sure the Soros backed globalist like you are all thrilled.
Shut up RINO
Butt out ! Don't want your backing ask trump
Thank you senator for being the savior of the people's health care
You are not the President you liar . 
:)
yeah congratulate your globalist friend..
If you're endorsing them, they must be crooked, look who endorses your votes ===> @AARP
@SenJohnMcCain is the best Democrat ever 
MCCAIN! YOU SHOULD BE CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR PUTTING AMERICA & ITS CITIZENS 1ST! FAKE PATRIOTIC AMERICAN !
I don't know there is a lot of reconsideration from EU about the reliability of America and it's direction.
Im really afraid that trump is going to alienate all of our allies if he doesnt get us killed in nuclear attack first.
MCCAIN : DO NOTHING PATRONIZING  SENATOR :  IN LEAGUE WITH GLOBAL BUSINESS/POLITICAL ENTITIES : CANNOT SUPPORT TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA!
Thank You, Mr. President
It was a wonderful day for me!
Blowhard McCain!
#leaderofthefreeworld
Sorry @PutinRF_Eng you didn't get this one
Fuck Germany
When are you going to care about America???? You need to retire !!
Just go away. For German's to elect this lady that is destroying their culture and put the people are risk indicates their stupidy.
You should come and visit germany to talk about our land. Germany is colourful, free and full of love! 
We need to start listening to you not your POTUS counterpart.
I'm worried Mr. McCain.  I feel Trump predicted your move of a No vote and has a very sneaky back up plan
Let's hope you're correct Linda! 
Tell trump that sir. He is killing America.
And you need to retire
McCain, you suck.
Sure YOU have the BEST HEALTHCARE.  I can't AFFORD any.  So many Americans SICK AND ILL and can't afford Doctors and u are SCREWING AMERICA
Congratulations;)
Retirement Buddy
Yea thanks to the biggist socialist in Europe...THE DESY
Angela Merkel will be new leader of free world.  Sad for US in one way but relieved free world will soon have strong, responsible leader.
Angela Merkel will kill Germany for Mr. Global if the Germans give her long enough. Of course voting is probably a complete farce in Germany
What are you talking about  You should come and visit germany to talk about our land. Germany is colourful, free and full of love! 
Spoken like a President!
@senjohnmccain YOU ARE THE BEST!!!! Thank you
RINO TRATOR 
Victory? The way she treats the problem in Germany are the reason she’s a looser!If you are a “refugee“ in Germany you are above the law. 
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Sen. McCain for you courage and wisdom and being more presidential then Trump! You truly a hero!
Germany election?  Let's focus on US.... North Korea and Health Care. U r going to bankrupt me... get off the "R" bus.
Then boot the liar in chief out of office senator.
Senator, focus on your vote against fellow GOP.   Stop playing games with americans healthcare because you hate Trump.  Worthless.
Be nice if @potus realized that, too. Instead everything is some weird junior high power play that makes us all look like jackasses.
@POTUS IS STILL WORKING TO TRASH THAT RELATIONSHIP! https://soundcloud.com/wick-beavers/fuck-donald-trump-62717 …
We don't need declarations from you least of all you. Traitor to your party.
We in Europe don't need comments from the American far-right. BLOCKED.
Senator John McCain, you are a repeat hero...we salute you and thank you over and over and over for your patriotism.
I honor your Military Service, but your politics, especially now, harms our President and our Nation. Your honor no longer shines. USA first
Keep your nose out of Europe! You grassed your fellow POW just like Merkel has shit on Europe #Brexit #POTUS
If you are so proud of yourself, why didn't you run on your intended platform instead of lying & misrepresenting yourself to voters in Az?
Thank you John for standing up- you have never answered me - but have original photos cause I was there at Clark AFB as a Teen to greet you.
Of course you're a Merkel fan she has sold out her country as well.
The world needs her now more than ever .
Thank you Senator McCain for ou no vote
.@SenJohnMcCain , thank you, Mr. President!!!
And THANK YOU, JOHN MCCAIN, MAY YOUR CONSCIENCE CONTINUE TO GUIDE YOUR HEART!
Songbird go to bed
Left is left and so are you lied to your constituents
You wouldn't know victory even though Nixon pardoned You victors don't go against the good of the country #TermLimits
Being tortured does not make you anything it makes you a POW nothing else that doesn't earn you anything respect is earned not demanded
Amen to that!
Merkel is destroying Europe with her insane immigration.... you've seen the frequency of attacks across Europe, and you congratulate her?!
She's the leader of the free world
As long as she doesn't side with Trump
I'm thankful for 
@AngelaMerkeICDU stepping up to be the Leader of Free World
until we get OUR house in order
TY Sen. McCain - #TheMaverick
THANKS AGAIN SEN. MCCAIN FOR VOTING AGAINST STUPIDITY!
OMG you've LOST UR MIND! PLEASE STEP DOWN.. Did you arm #ISIS/#AlQueda? this is why we're in such a mess B4 Nov8 2016 #RecallJohnMccain
Communism still lives with McCain
#Germany This is NOT a victory. She cannot reach a majority either with the FDP or the Greens. And both together - how will that pan out?
Your right! Greetings from germany 
Sen McCain, we could have had a Strong Female Leader, too, but Russia/Trump ruined that for US 
Grow up.
We should be concerned at the Alternative for Germany party's gain.  That party sees support in our president's conduct.
87% of the germans did NOT vote for AFD. 87% are the people of germany, not these 13% stupid people who forgot about our horrible past...
Angela  Merkel is a true leader both in Germany and Europe
Glad u have great insurance. Must be nice?
Communist!
Must have been a fixed election. She's done nothing but screw Germany up. No way the people would want her. Soros at work again
MCCain = ISIS
Thank you Senator McCain.
Thank God, now if only the US could find a capable leader...
Traitor
One Vote Johnie unfortunately she did something you could never accomplish or do.  Your voice no longer valid.  Ste down
Senator Sir what will you do about Trumps Nuclear Ideation?
