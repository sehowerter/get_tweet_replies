You are the one who should be deported
They are ILLEGAL!!!!
There is no Fight. Get legislation in place within the next 6 months so that DACA is replaced. Stop the Political PREJUDICE and #DoYourJob
Don't be such a fool, trump doesn't want it replaced... due process would see a replacement before abruptly shutting it down.
Due process? We have a congress that gets nothing done because they are all wasting time spewing political PREJUDICE. Due process? Be real.
If Bernie was president he wouldn't waste time on DACA!!! Get a clue, trump is wasting tax$ undoing something Obama created. That's real!
Bernie was screwed by @HillaryClinton and then he endorsed her. He wasn't even in the race for president. Obama's DACA executive order.....
Will be replaced with a LAW that actually went through congress. We are not all D's or R's but we are all Americans. #StopSeparation
if you think there will be a law to keep immigrants here you are a fool! Not while travel ban trump is in office he hates non-white people.
They say that so clowns who support that dipshit trump will believe he is doing good when he's never done good in his life. Also a rapist
Bernie Sanders ! Barry Obama, created this mess ! President Trump is actually cleaning House, that's what Good Leader's do ! 
Good leaders dn't take you to the brink of war just so he can sell weapons
Really ! What War, are you referring ? Please provide facts ! 
Filipino families wait 25-30 years after approved immigration for their visas, and #DACA recipients will only wait 13 years? #unfair #unjust
No you wont!!!
This is severely wrong. Both parties dislike illegal immigration yes? REGUARDLESS WETHER THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE, THEY ARE ILLEGAL!!!
Anyone who serves in our military deserves automatic citizenship. Period.

What about the 1.6m babies murdered in the USA each year through abortion. Those we can do without but thevare exemplary? #hypocrite
Bull.  Law needs to be made by Congress, not the Exec.  You cowards have failed to do it and take credit (or blame) for your actions.
They are not citizens!
Only way DACA can become a law is through congress. Why does @SenSanders & all the left make this about @realDonaldTrump?
Because in 2010 Jeff Sessions led the fillabuster to stopthe passing of the Immigration reform act.
Still not about @realDonaldTrump ... you realize that right? That was my entire point...
Well said Bernie
Save it for someone who cares Bernie what about the ones who raped and murdered people?  Are they exemplary too? #hypocrite
Commie!!
Fuck Daca. We can't be the welfare state for the whole world.
Tell ALL Americans who don't believe the benefits of legalizing the DACA, Senator Sanders. Illegals have made America their home too..
Except none are serving in the military. You must have a green card to enlist. All in DACA status are held in DEP. None wear the uniform.
If Congress had have done their job in the first place, we would not be in this situation.  It was a temporary Ex. Order.

What u better do is get ur ass to work,otherwise those dreamers will see ur RESIST/OBSTRUCTION as acts of DemoKKKrats the deportation Party
They also murder CITIZEN'S children.
Democrats are worried about illegal immigrants instead of taking care of Black Americans #DirtyPolitics
#AmericaFirst #DeportIllegals. Like others hardworking immigrats that came here legally, __that's how they should come in__
That ugly old man needs to go back to his mom's basement.
Where are Melania's papers? Trump said he will show how she was legally here when he met her.   Are her papers being audited W his taxes?
They know it's career killer if they support amnesty or DACA in Congress. Both parties have lobbied to end illegals at one point
Deport all #DACA illegal aliens and their illegal alien parents. Keep families together! Deport them all. 

#EndDACA, No #Amnesty
True, most Americans support the Dreamers. The rest are supporters of Russia and their Pumpkin Face traitor!
Bernie, Trump has given you and all your spineless peers the chance to fix immigration.  Stop whining and do your job.  GET IT DONE!
There's no fight just law
You  will win DACA fight? On what legal ground. It's an executive order, unconstitutional one by the way. Even Obama admitted it.
Elaborate!
Bernie, you of all people understand the illegal and unconstitutional basis on which DACA was established! An exec order will not hold up.
And then there's #NY01 @repleezeldin who compares DACA recipients to faucet leaks #shameonzeldin #flipthe1st
Show me the facts and stop with all the emotional arguments.
Your freakout have anything to do with your not wanting anyone to notice you've been there for years, and have not done anything for them?
Illegal immigrants are getting preference over black Americans.  The left continues to use us for politics, nothing has gotten better in Chi
#daca has not been eliminated. It still in force. Pay attention and stop getting yourbfakenews @ #cnn for your research before a speech.
That's 800,000 #democrat party voters you really don't want deported right... The real reason always exposed in the end
They aren't registered to vote. Maybe IF GOP actually worked forthem,  they may register for them WHEN THEY CAN.
Bottom Line ! It's Not Right to Take these kids that were already born here, Already going to College here, Already Serving in our Military
Cant they apply  for a green card.
Depends on who's backing them.  It still takes yearsand thousandsof $$$.
Shut up bernie baby
Then pass a DACA bill clown.
Bernie is such a fraud, he and everyone in Congress knew that DACA would eventually end, why is he feigning outrage now because it's safe .

They won't do anything but marry an American citizen for citizenship. Or have a baby like they always do
Question, what problems has Bernie solved so far, talks a good game but things remain the same but he sure loves the notoriety, ego booster
Doesn't Mr Sanders take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution not deviate from it, DACA is no fight to be won it's one to be solved
Go get em Bernie!!
To hell with Sanders
In her new book, Hillary said you are both a racist and sexist. How do you respond, Bernie?
Trump is just asking you Senator to do your Job something you have not done for years
Not all of them . Ass wipe. What a moron! Welfare a-holes . Rapists Gang murderers. Some of them are that. Wake UP! UP! WAKE UP! Lot of bad.
Since Fueher Bernie loves big government. Why can't he understand DACA is an act of Congress not Preseident. Do something,  Fidel
Even Obama said it was not his authority and left it to Congress. Stop lying and #dosomething
If they all applied to citizenship,  it might be resolved by the time Congress acts on it... hmmm?,
Kitty is funny
Follow the Goddamn law
It's Congresses fix, not Trumps
Senator, Hillary Clinton blame you and everything else for her lost except herself. Please just go away lady!!
But if they forged any IDs or work permits they've already committed a felony.
Happy Birthday Bernie and thank you for always fighting for us
And the conditions are or should I say the demands?
Don't forget to do the same..
If you fought for CITIZENS with as much effort as you put toward non citizens, you might have stood a chance last year
We are all citizens of the world.. 
Go to South Korea say that bullshit. I'll tell your family u love them.
Illegals DO NOT HAVE RIGHTS. NO CITIZEN=NO RIGHTS. They need to apply for citizenship. Not to hard to understand
They will, they just need a legislation that allows them to do it quickly.. they are running out of time.
Well you will need to fight this guy who started it all.

DACA temporary
Not permanent

DACA=illegals first America never
LESS THAN 600 ARE SERVING THE MILITARY OUT OF 800,000 PLUS DACA YOUTH.?? 1.2M LEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME TO THE USA EACH YR.?????
You forgot one Bernie they are illegal.
Trump has done nothing but force you do nothing, obstructionist hypocrites to finally do your job and pass some legislation. 5 mos. 27 days!
All that would count greatly if they were here legally. Otherwise they are wasting their time and ours. 
Yup. All you want is money.
Nope. Trump was rich before he runs office as POTUS.
why wasn't this handled on Obamas watch?..ummm yah thats why
HE TRIED TO but the Republicans were almost completely against it. He wanted to create a path to citizenship for them, he was blocked.
Obama said he didn't have the authority to do it - but he did - hence the garbage we're dealing with
President Reagan & George H.W. Bush, did similar orders via executive authority. It's been done before.
Hey stupid all POTUS did was force you dolts in congress to do your job and vote on it
And they are breaking the law. Sanders as a congressman you could have fixed it under Obama but too lazy dont whine now do your job.
I assume you didn't actually read anything? Essentially nothing will happen.
Do your job Bernie...Obama put this thing in place illegally an now Trump wants it done right but you oppose the right thing,HYPOCRITE!
Here's why we have a problem with it. Asking an entire group of people to exist in limbo does irreparable damage.
Go Bernie!
vermont's governor
#DACA #Facts STATISTICS There are at Least 50k #Dreamers in CA JAILS!!
Stop whining about having to do your job and pass a law.
Maybe you should have supported Sen Ted Kennedy bill and we might not have found ourselves in this situation.
Hay Bernie there aren't enough socialist in America to do anything but blow wind as u do. Read the immigration laws. U aren't king Obama.
What fight you creepy old kook?  This is congress' issue to deal with now.  Do your job and quit the bellyaching.
dude, FFS comb your damn hair.
Ya that's important...
Congressional leaders have lost their way. I paid taxes for 60 yrs. I get in more trouble for having a expired drivers license then ILLEGALS
No illegals and no amnesty
Exemplary young people that willingly violated law, and continue to do so.
Bernie, you're just talking out of your ass now.  The boy who cried wolf.
You and your six 16 year old supporters?
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1520 …
Nice try Bernie.  Some DACA are criminals. Other DACA are frauds because they didn't qualify as DACA but Obama looked the other way.
President trump has already won the DACA fight. Fund the wall, pass the Raise Act, eliminate chain immigration and pass DACA, do tax reform.
There is speed in his action.. of course just a few understand that #DACA is leverage, to get what He wants..

Every one of them? Saying "THEY" does not create a substantiative argument. Perhaps "THEY tend to vote left" would be more accurate.
Well I want Americans working! If only you cared half as much for Americans as you do for those here illegally Bernie you may have beat HRC
Enforcing the law is more ugly and cruel that dismembering unborn children?!?  Cray old coot.
Bernie loves immigrants so much that his new waterfront vacation home is in the whitest part of the whitest state. Why not Winooski Bernie??
Deport bank fraud bernie,, make America Great Again
Bernie. Is he not the grumpiest, most sour, and offensive person you know?  Retire Bernie. Go relax and smile somewhere.

Bernie, it's NOT President's authority. TALK TO CONGRESS. You shd know which branch of gov't handles immigration.
If they are so "exemplary " then how about they become Legal Citizens!
They legally can't.
GOP sees those 800K BROWN PEOPLE, as Unlikley to VOTE GOP. Educated,Pay Taxes, in our Military, SOLID PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR THEIR VOTE.......
..... It's ALL ABOUT VOTER SUPRESSION, 800K becomes 1.6M, becomes 3.2M. PEOPLE OF COLOR VOTE OUT GOP. GOP Works only for Wealthy Bigots!
Simple Math! 195M Reg Voters BEATS 5M Reg Voters EVERY TIME!  This Strength can change EVERYTHING. HEALTHCARE,SOLVENT SS, MEDICARE,MEDICAID.
Cowardly Paul Ryan wants to take away these "Entitlements" HE Calls them! They are NOT ENTITLEMENTS. GOP(Ryan) Gives Huge Breaks to Rich GOP
Why VOTE GOP. They Promise "GOD & GUNS"! You have those already Protected by Constitution! GOP = FEAR & HATE! How 'Bout GOV that CARESFORYOU
They are working. They are illegal and taking American citizens jobs! They are avg age of 16 to 35. Not children! Say no to amnesty!
how unlucky americans are to not to get a chance to elect sanders as president. but hope they'll soon
As a senator, he best should know the power to fix this lies with Congress. Trump appropriately returned it to them after Obama took it.
Hope you are introducing legislation to fix it

Eventually you'll get there too. Chin up!
They are rescuing at our disaster sites!
Much work left to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace is not dead!
