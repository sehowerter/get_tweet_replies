@WhiteHouse We already have ways to stop children from pulling the trigger on a gun.  No new law needed.
@SusanASAMOM @WhiteHouse Whats your way??? Because people are destroying each other. Especially this new generation.
@adriandentreal @WhiteHouse  Enforce the laws.  Making new gun laws 4 people hell bent on hurting some1 will not stop that.
@SusanASAMOM @WhiteHouse ok, I see your point of view. But too many have access to guns. Just like drugs.
@adriandentreal @SusanASAMOM @WhiteHouse all law abiding citizens should have access to a firearm. Criminals are the problem not guns.
@TylersVoice2You @SirDreadguard @SusanASAMOM @WhiteHouse you are right. But guns create an idea. The very idea that you could shoot someone.
@WhiteHouse oh good grief. Responsible gun owners don't just leave their guns laying around.
@btv_25 @WhiteHouse Then this wont effect them
@ColeJones3 @WhiteHouse IMO we need to call out the irresponsible folks directly.
@btv_25 @WhiteHouse If only we could, every time we try, the NRA launches another counter campaign
@ColeJones3 @WhiteHouse so you honestly think the @NRA doesn't want gun owners to be safe and responsible?
@btv_25 @WhiteHouse @NRA I think their backers care more about money than saftey, the NRA used to advocate for tighter gun laws and such
@ColeJones3 @WhiteHouse @NRA backers? Gun manufacturers?
@btv_25 @WhiteHouse @NRA Among others, yes. They pulled a 180
@sky6709 @WhiteHouse tell that to the parents that have guns in their homes, cars, purses, etc & their kids have died due to gun accidents
@sky6709 @WhiteHouse laughable. Truth hurts, so does losing a child needlessly
@sky6709 @WhiteHouse you can justify any way you would like. 30k plus gun deaths per yr are unacceptable.
@WhiteHouse I will never trust electronics in a gun!
MOLON LABE
@WhiteHouse um yeah. Don't understand how others don't see this.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse what a stupid comment. This is supposed to be some sort of meaningful analogy I guess(?) gun safes work well
time to stop the violence #WearOrange #momsagainstgunviolence
@WhiteHouse true that
@WhiteHouse How in the hell did you ever become pResident with such stupid idea's? GFY
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama same logic: school can't give tylenol without parental permission shouldn't give birth conrol either
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how many federal gun are shot by minors seem like waste of money  to me
@WhiteHouse @orange_parrot19 These days maybe we should disarm the fire happy police!
@WhiteHouse the definition of infringement is an encroachment or trespass on a right or privilege a little at a time.
@WhiteHouse idiots only gang bangers left there gun laying around
@WhiteHouse Perfectly said, thanks!
@WhiteHouse Amen!
@WhiteHouse don't worry no gun owner would ever let that child who pitches temper tantrums in the White House touch a gun!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama should our arthritic elders who can't open aspirin botlles lose their rights to bear arms?
@WhiteHouse @orange_parrot19 This I agree with I just dont agree with losing our 2nd amendment rights.
@WhiteHouse  4 ACTRESS WHO WENT UNDER TOTAL TRANSFORMATION FOR ROLE https://goo.gl/v0X92N    
#NationalChampionship
@WhiteHouse how about you worry about defense of the nation, controlling spending, reducing government theft(taxes) I'll worry about my kids
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse how about the teen who is emotionally troubled and needs help?
@WhiteHouse it appears the republicans just don't understand this is not about the right to bear arms it is about the safety of country!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ư
@WhiteHouse Maybe just like raising minimum wage for federal workers, we should implement smart gun tech. into police issue guns.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, why are we scared of women and children refugees?
@WhiteHouse that man Good
@WhiteHouse lame duck will do anything to distract from his terrible record of reducing violence.
@WhiteHouse The cure for gun violence is jobs, substance abuse clinics and more mental health facilities, anything else is a waste of time.
@WhiteHouse Great point. In both cases lives are possibly being saved.
@WhiteHouse aaaand it's the spoons fault people are obese.  You can't fix stupid. Let Darwinism rule
@WhiteHouse that's what I need. To pull my gun on an intruder and find out the battery is dead!
@WhiteHouse but a child can open a child proof container earsier than most adults.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Mr. President, you are 100% correct. You should not try to take away the 2nd Ammendment rights of the U.S.
@WhiteHouse 

This falls on irresponsible gun owners. A select few.
@WhiteHouse anger is from the dark side, so control our anger and have a peaceful mind and a loving heart.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Hey @ potus @whitehouse, do you have any comments on the terrorist attack? He pled his allegiance to ISIS
@WhiteHouse  #idiot
@WhiteHouse @Feltindonks Don't children usually have an easier time opening those than adults?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Thank you President Obama for your courageous gun control and common sense executive approach. #Cecemobley424
@WhiteHouse , soon as ewe get the guns away from gangs in Chicago , we can talk then. Otherwise zip it !!!
#StateofJefferson
#YEEHAWD
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes
@WhiteHouse if a president can't enforce existing laws, he shouldn't make new ones.
@WhiteHouse I support the common sense logic of our president
@WhiteHouse Ever heard of something on the gun called safety?
@WhiteHouse more kids die from five gallon bucket drownings
@WhiteHouse some parents are idiots and leave bottle sitting out with cap off. Can't protect the stupid and careless
@WhiteHouse Do you know anything about guns since you spend so much time on the golf course?
@WhiteHouse How many of your secret service people are you going to lose because of the vets clause?
@WhiteHouse Most kids have little trouble opening aspirin. Why not try enforcing existing laws first? #Liberty
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse not the same thing nice try not buying what your selling
@WhiteHouse   Thank you so much Mr. President!!  You are the best POTUS ever!
@WhiteHouse valid question because I keep my Sig in the medicine cabinet.
@WhiteHouse yeah it's called a safety
@WhiteHouse ...which is covered by, responsible gun ownership means protecting your children from misuse of your legal guns via locks
@WhiteHouse really u guys are a bunch of liars lets be honest this administration has destroyed this country stop lies and tell the truth
@WhiteHouse What's stopping a child from pulling the trigger on their dad's circular saw? Getting in the car and driving? Good parenting.
@WhiteHouse if u want to keep children from pulling triggers ,then stop making guns so easily accesible in the house or workplace,..
@whitehouse  / They need to stop all the gun's just stop them and save our chidren's!
@WhiteHouse Thank you so much! Here's a link for you from Intelligun. Maybe you can help them. http://www.intelligun.com 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS silly analogy. overwhelming vast majority of millions of guns are under lock and key. over sentimental and foolish.
@WhiteHouse thats a good Way to put it!!
@WhiteHouse witch is why we should use the electronic gun that uses a fingertip scan or the electronic gun that with a watch u wear with it
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Re: your response to the woman who was raped:
@WhiteHouse  The 'future' is the key word here...shaping our future 2 not include the things associated w/ violence IS key to our wellbeing
@WhiteHouse USA is a laughing stock around the world when it come to fifth amendment rights. Gun toting Cowboys!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama except they can. Even with the ' childproof' caps.
@WhiteHouse As soon as law enforcement & military willing to use the technology on duty weapons, population will be more willing to accept.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama we are giving u.s citizens a terrible message when them white men in org.OCCUPY gov land armed to a T
@WhiteHouse Meaning any attempt to take our guns away in general is federal offense set down by the Founding Fathers. Just reminding ya.
@WhiteHouse 2nd Amendment, The Right to bear arms shall not be infingured.
@WhiteHouse Actually, if they are probably trained in the 1st place there are less likely to have a accident. The NRA encourage this.
@WhiteHouse THATS SO TRUE
@WhiteHouse then let's teach kids more about gun safety instead of making the kids ignorant about potential dangers
@WhiteHouse soooo we need to push down and twist or line up the arrows to shoot a gun... wtf smh
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama glad you are still the president
@WhiteHouse y u inc every yr most of $ on defense, sm of our people's(world) don't hv fd on 1 day. pls help our nation.
@WhiteHouse Thanks
@WhiteHouse rediculous
@WhiteHouse:If we are so concerned about children and Aspirin, let's quit aborting so many before birth and calling it women's health
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what?! So kids shouldn't be able to hunt or defend themselves if the need arises? Insanity as usual from this prez
@WhiteHouse The sentiment is good but the means you are utilizing will fail just like past efforts have and for one simple reason...
@WhiteHouse New legislation and safety technology does nothing if the firearms that are already in the hands of violent criminals...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #Amen
@WhiteHouse A claim accomplished with a weapon violently can't be a right claim.
#GunsInAmerica   #gunscontrol #StopGunViolence
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama is a great man the true light of American democracy exceptionally strong nation
@WhiteHouse The world doesn't move in the #WhiteHouse.The world moves in front of the people in the world. Each people has #politics powers.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama President Obama....the only President to take gun control seriously !
@WhiteHouse introduce a new standard of technology and then ban all preexisting guns. straight from the KGB handbook
@WhiteHouse Then make it sure!
@WhiteHouse Is the intent to control access to guns or stop mass shootings? 1 is infringement, the other imperative.The difference, critical
@WhiteHouse criminal s will still have there guns
@WhiteHouse its not the kids shooting people it s the illegal s doing the shooting your hurting the honest person not the criminal
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 剁手？？
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama im agree with obama we must stop the gun violence
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Еnough to sit in credits        http://goo.gl/TQ8aj4 
@WhiteHouse THE PRESIDENT IS CORRECT, BUT TO CONTROL GUN VIOLANCE, WE MUST BE TOUGHER ON ILLEGAL CRIMINAL GUN OWNERS AND SELLERS.
@WhiteHouse #KeepOutOfReachOfChildren #ResponsibilityStartsAtHomes
@WhiteHouse if money is going to be spent spend it on parenting and marriage counsel.  We don't need gun control we need solid family units!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS How about operation fast and furious? It's ok to arm Drug Cartels for Free? GTFOH Idiots.. Vote TRUMP2016
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama - So proud of/grateful for Pres. BO's leadership. So glad I campaigned for him in 2008. #StopGunViolence
@WhiteHouse That gun should be secured I support gun safety training prior to gun ownership every one in place or home kids have gun talk
.@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why not use the Federal government's power as the gun manufacturers' biggest customer to force them to change?
@WhiteHouse how about educating children...what a novel idea!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 24 lb trigger pulls.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I have my CHP and I carry everywhere it is legal. #GunsInAmerica
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama when a child's lifesaving medications are no longer covered, we should make sure #Obamacare is fully repealed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
If no bullet is in the chamber the gun is harmless.
A gun in the hands of a responsible adult citizen is good.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
A bottle of aspirin or a gun should never be within a child's reach to begin with.
@WhiteHouse that's why God created gun safes and locks. Parents need to be responsible and held criminally liable for not doing so.
@WhiteHouse law abiding families that have lived or grown up around safe gun practises rarely have accidents.
@WhiteHouse Need to start with all Federal agency's convert all to smart guns in the next few months then will see how that goes.
@WhiteHouse a weapon that is locked up is no longer available for personal defense. Only education of your family will make them safe.
@WhiteHouse if police can not protect us from criminals. Making it difficult for honest Americans to defend themselves is no solution .
@WhiteHouse very proud of the president!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOU LEAVE OFFICE FOR GOOD!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama And how would you enforce either?
@WhiteHouse But it is OK when the child's father kills people when driving drunk. Make it illegal to commit a crime with a gun. Federal.
@WhiteHouse: "If a child can’t open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure they can’t pull…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=685271220963639296 …
@WhiteHouse First ensure that Guns are not as readily available as Bottles of  Aspirin.
@WhiteHouse you should make sure first that no one enters the U.S illegally
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama child safety caps are aimed at stopping a 5 year old not a 15 year old. Education is the best prevention.
@WhiteHouse 
like tittle for a car, passport to travel; track and record each gun and owner & make them smart guns.
@WhiteHouse if a baby cant say dont abort me then maybe we ought to not abort them.
@WhiteHouse  
I get it...
@WhiteHouse - we already have something for that.   They are called gun locks.  No need to reinvent the wheel.   #GunsInAmerica
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama .I AGREE. GREAT ANALOGY. PROBLEM, MOST AMERICANS, NOT THAT REASONABLE TO THINK.
@WhiteHouse No one who has ever been in combat would ever risk the use of "smart gun" technology.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Deportation of Central American #Refugees is Inhumane → http://bit.ly/1Rwbiab  by @WalterAEwing #immigration
@WhiteHouse that's what locks and safes are for. Really??? Think of something legitimate to state.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
@Humbertom842H

@WhiteHouse Here Obama, it is called a trigger lock.
@WhiteHouse this quite slaps yah upside the head Usr during the election . . . #nothingtolose
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama An overarching value in constitution is "common good". That in tandem with 2 A should be considered 4 public safety
@WhiteHouse GUN SAFES!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Perfecta la expresión. Siga comprometido Sr. Presidente, los niños merecen su mayor esfuerzo. Ahora deben aprender
@WhiteHouse  ghanshyampal
@WhiteHouse how did humanity survive so long without more gun laws?
@WhiteHouse can't the American citzens have a right to say on a ballot if guns must have safety? Amend Constitution. VOTE
@WhiteHouse what if their parents left the cap off the aspirin bottle?
@WhiteHouse @potus let's hold parents accountable for not parenting? #nomorefreebes #dontgetoffeasy
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse yes u r totally 100% correct. Thank u for the statement..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama can't we just have similar gun laws to japan? I never heard of a single school shooting there. America is failing
@WhiteHouse @RepHankJohnson Hey Hank did Guam tip over yet?
