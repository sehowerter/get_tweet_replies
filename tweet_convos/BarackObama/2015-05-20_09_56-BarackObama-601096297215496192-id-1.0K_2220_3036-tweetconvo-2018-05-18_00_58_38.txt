@Phillipchasew We've been running from climate change for who knows how many millennia ...
@WhiteHouse if global warming were true i would have asthma so would everyone in world & at the rate claimed we would all be died 3 yearsago
@WhiteHouse no they aren't...
@veryannoyedcon @WhiteHouse you ever look at a chart of co2 in the atmosphere over the last 600 years?  They find older measures in ice....
@DaveIvanic @WhiteHouse also tell me how 600 years compared to 4.5 billion is any measure of accuracy?
@WhiteHouse @official_barak Is that so? However people dig holes under deepsea and hot seawater above 662ºF spouts from them and never stop.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What if all the head of states in the world sign and implement the Kyoto Protocal?
@WhiteHouse @official_barak I'd like to know what can be expected if we do not make Corrective measures with our planet ?
@WhiteHouse I don't believe it.
@WhiteHouse  MANY PEOPLE,  SPECIALLY  REPUBLICANS, PRETEND GLOBAL  WORMING IS NOT HAPPENING,  THEY  ARE STUPID HUMANS, #ACTONCLIMATE
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what about more important things going on
@WhiteHouse It will be interesting .. try to be involved
@WhiteHouse Uneven distribution of steam in air may cause severe weather. That occurs by electricity in air similar to water hydrogen bond.

@WNHousekeeping @WhiteHouse @POTUS hater? #Not -- Believer that the Office of the Presidency should be held in dignity & knowledge #Yes
@0bama_2012 greatest president ever and a true human being
@WhiteHouse I'm tired of millionaires who live in mansions, ride in private jets & limos preach about how "we" have to #ActOnClimate
.@WhiteHouse 
Growth is slowing
Labor force participation decreasing
Food stamp usage soaring
Wages ARENT rising

Its time to #ActonEconomy
@BonkPolitics @WhiteHouse yes a great way to build the economy is with a nation wide program to create green jobs! Have we forgotten #sandy
@AnalogPlayers You mean, like a Gov't run stimulus program where the .@WhiteHouse picks the green companies to support? #beentheredonethat
@BonkPolitics @WhiteHouse still waiting to hear your solution ?
.@AnalogPlayers Already gave it to you.  You just didn't like it.
@BonkPolitics specifically one private sector suggestion. How does it help my small business get support.
.@AnalogPlayers I think we've reached maximum tediousness here.  Good night.
@BonkPolitics check out zillow , loopnet ( real estate ) then overlay the hurricane map. :-)

@WhiteHouse #REALObamaLegacy: #HoneyIShranktheEconomy
@WhiteHouse we can't win this war until we capture those who prepared the "platform" to help form Dictatorship,... regards
@WhiteHouse and its hard to believe that US-NASA wasn't informed about it. even Japan-Germany can't handle people's mind, quake-Tsunami.....
@WhiteHouse the Dictatorship on India was mainly "handled" by those, who were controlling people's mind, quake-Tsunami threats on civilians.
@WhiteHouse we must first capture those who had handicapped Indian government agencies to help form dictatorship,while threatening civilians
@WhiteHouse Indian government agencies were,in fact, made "handicapped" so that no resistance is left against the Dictatorship, confirm it
@WhiteHouse we can't win against terrorism-dictatorship targeting a democratic country,until we first capture those who help these offenders
@WhiteHouse we can't win this war until we capture those who prepared the "platform" to help form Dictatorship, ... regards
@WhiteHouse and its hard to believe that US-NASA wasn't informed about it. even Japan-Germany can't handle people's mind, quake-Tsunami....
@WhiteHouse the Dictatorship on India was mainly "handled" by those, who were controling people's mind, quake-Tsunami threats on civilians
@WhiteHouse we must capture those first who had handicapped Indian government agencies to help form dictatorship,while threatening civilians
@WhiteHouse we can't win against terrorism-dictatorship against a democratic country, until we first capture those who help these terrorists
@WhiteHouse and then Dictatorship over India as the Final Step. first conspiracy was plotted to help these offenders supporting Dictatorship
@WhiteHouse sir its openly done, first civilians of India were terrorized by quake-Tsunami,putting a control over India during last 6 months
@WhiteHouse there is no difference between terrorists targeting civilians, than those who who target civilians by Earth Quake- Flood-Tsunami
@WhiteHouse Offenders occupying government positions of India were first helped by threatening civilians by quake-Tsunami, are they caught?
@WhiteHouse the offenders occupying government positions of India were first helped by quake-Tsunami threats on civilians,what action taken?
@WhiteHouse also, first Independence of India was bargained by threatening common civilians by earth quake-Tsunami,has US got guilty behind?
@WhiteHouse we would need over 200,000 military personnel of US+UN, to have a control over India, how long will it take?
@WhiteHouse foreigners helping Dictatorship in a democratic country are regarded as terrorists,who must be killed to help UN forces in India
@WhiteHouse US must kill those foreign nationals occupying govt positions of India, by controlling their bodies,until we get help from US+UN
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals helping dictatorship in another country, while being on soil of India, become part of this terrorism on India
@WhiteHouse the False ID foreign nationals helping Dictatorship, whether on government or in common, must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse US+UN forces on alert to enter India,along with whatever immediate government officials may be sent from US+EU to help civilians
@WhiteHouse it first includes Pakistan+Bangladesh whose spies are occupying government positions of India from back door, with Saudi A.+UAE
@WhiteHouse The Countries guilty in terrorism/dictatorship against Democratic India, must first face sanctions to stop aggression from there
@WhiteHouse hence first few points as below:-
@WhiteHouse with a US aircraft carrier in Arabic Sea also, to seal Indian water borders from the foreign fighters who may sneak into India
@WhiteHouse as they are found guilty in this ongoing terrorism against Largest Democratic Country of world, terrorized with Dictatorship now
@WhiteHouse regardless what happens in India, Saudi A.+UAE must first be imposed with all sanctions, diplomatic/trade all, as the first step
@WhiteHouse and you are responsible to clean your shiit, like how you go to toilet and clear your shiits by yourself, without help of others
@WhiteHouse under a conspiracy, these things were kept secret from common public during last 20+ years. hence you do know what you was doing
@WhiteHouse this process of occupying government positions of India from back door was continued for last 20+ years, which was allowed by US
@WhiteHouse also, Britain placed these foreigners on government positions under False Indian IDs, who first report to British government
@WhiteHouse like how my body is controlled from top to bottom by space,what measures are adopted to kill these False ID foreigners fighters?
@WhiteHouse hence, it would be easy to kill these offenders, the terrorists helping dictatorship in India by controlling their bodies itself
@WhiteHouse UK/Commonwealth Recruitment know who are they, where they came from, with controlling their bodies too? similar to me?
@WhiteHouse and it would be easy as these people entered into India by "commonwealth recruitment", hence you know them, obviously?
@WhiteHouse we want US+UN forces to occupy the key defence areas and government buildings, mainly the nuclear reactors, sooner is possible
@WhiteHouse hence we want direct sealing of Pakistan+Bangladesh border considering mainly spies of these 2 nations are on the govt positions
@WhiteHouse as its now open that False ID foreigners on government positions helping foreigners, mainly Pakistani+Bangladeshi enter India
@WhiteHouse and we first need to put those foreigners in Wanted List of Interpol, who occupying Indian IDs from back door during this period
@WhiteHouse as common Indian civilians are unarmed,Foreign Nationals entered India since dictatorship,must be put in wanted list of Interpol
@WhiteHouse hence, Saudi A.+UAE must be recognized as rogue nations, involved in this ongoing Terrorism against Largest Democratic Country
@WhiteHouse I'm told, foreign nations like UAE-Saudi Arabia are guiding these False ID offenders occupying key government positions in India
@WhiteHouse Part 2, Terrorism in India under Dictatorship by False ID foreigners, placed here under "Commonwealth Recruitment"
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Why must you continue lending creedence and and implement policy based on junk science that just is not true?
@WhiteHouse thanks and regards
@WhiteHouse i remember BP oil spill, and this is what British government has done, impacting world's environment now
@WhiteHouse will Britain support these offenders, placed on key positions by themselves under a conspiracy for years,or, help civilians?
@WhiteHouse how other democratic countries of world will respond to this certain scenario of India on the world platform?
@WhiteHouse we want a fair democratic election in India. we can't be ruled by a Dictator and his follower terrorists,entered India illegally
@WhiteHouse we would now need Human Rights watch dogs-journalists in every small town of India
@WhiteHouse mass protests while moving towards government buildings, will they be attacked or killed if they demand a democratic election?
@WhiteHouse i may see from here that common people may start doing protests on road, block roads, shut down of daily businesses activities
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN.
@WhiteHouse a government under Dictatorship has no recognition in world, no diplomatic/trade relation, their sports teams aren't invited too
@WhiteHouse similar to how they denied ISIL threats to enter into Iraq to get key information from there
@WhiteHouse as a world citizen,I now hope brave journalists of world to come to India and have a close watch on the human rights abuses here
@WhiteHouse we can't discuss democracy in our home country, if we don't do its practice on the world platform also
@WhiteHouse India as the largest democratic country of world, and hence it is also part of democratic values of US-UK on the world platform
@WhiteHouse none of the above 3 examples of dictator was regarded as lesser than terrorists, as this is main definition of a dictator
@WhiteHouse Dictator like Saddam was hanged as the penalty,Gaddafi of Libya was killed on road while running,but Hitler could be able to run
@WhiteHouse I want India to be declared as a war-zone, on the verge of internal conflicts by foreign infiltrators, occupying govt positions
@WhiteHouse until US-UN bring India under control for a fair democratic election, US must put these offenders under Wanted list of Interpol
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse first Independence of citizens was 'bargained' by quake-Tsunami threats, and the next step dictatorship? both are interlinked
@WhiteHouse and its impossible to believe that God or US dont know them? what measures were adopted to stop those acts?
@WhiteHouse its a serious case as controlling minds of people, quake-Tsunami etc can't be done by even Japan-Germany, who are behind this?
@WhiteHouse this is a terrorist attack on Indian citizens, as they were first threatened by earth quake-Tsunami etc to help these offenders
@WhiteHouse there can't be a legal status to the government under dictatorship until a fair democratic election is held under watch by US-UN
@WhiteHouse what measures the US government adopting, until we may have US's soldiers on the soil of India? and how long will it take?
@WhiteHouse Foreign nationals on Government-political positions are making statements to fuel religious riots, purposefully/ intentionally
@WhiteHouse foreign fighters-spies pretend to be similar to Indian Muslims citizens,which is a threat to religious riots among the civilians
@WhiteHouse we want new US embassies in different cities of India to help those civilians who are put under threat by foreign fighters/spies
@WhiteHouse are the victims and their dependents of fatal attacks provided with enough supports, until we have a fair democratic election?
@WhiteHouse does US know fatal attacks on the civilians of India doing usual political talks, as involved? what measures were adopted by US?
@WhiteHouse as per International laws since WW2, no diplomats-civilians talking usual politics can be fatally attacked during any war too
@WhiteHouse my demand is too fair as per international laws, we have even since during WW2, and the International laws must be maintained
@WhiteHouse we demand offenders against "Republic of India", to be put among 'Wanted Terrorists" of world,until they are capture or killed
@WhiteHouse No legal status can be granted to India under dictatorship, until fair democratic election is held, under watch by US and UN
@WhiteHouse the Infiltrators,who infiltrated Indian international border while hiding their identity,by occupying local Indian IDs illegally
@WhiteHouse India is a 'non-religious' country, and no favor must be done for any illegal infiltrators for their religious background
@WhiteHouse no foreign government has any right to destroy our country, our families/homes are based on, to rob our wealth of India this way
@WhiteHouse Indian tax payers pay hefty subsidy for people below poverty,pay salaries to government,invest in infrastructure to build nation
@WhiteHouse and it means, no foreigner can be regarded as an Indian citizen,since the dictatorship is established in India by the foreigners
@WhiteHouse only those kids of an illegal immigrant,took birth on soil of India with at least one parent Indian citizen,can have citizenship
@WhiteHouse what measures US has adopted to help the Indian citizens,if foreign governments handling these foreign fighters may offend here?
@WhiteHouse im myself looks like trapped here, along with local civilians. so i need my US passport and ticket to Indiana soon. thanks
@WhiteHouse US must offer short stay visas for those Indian civilians, who are kept under threats by these infiltrators,the foreign fighters
@WhiteHouse as, how unarmed Indian civilians will face those spies/goon/fighters,who may come to support these spies of Pakistan+Bangladesh?
@WhiteHouse no further people movement or trade be allowed to the Indian international borders, until we may have a fair democratic election
@WhiteHouse seeing the serious threats these people have imposed, we want Indian borders,including water border, to be in full control of US
@WhiteHouse in behalf of people im doing politics, i demand at least 200,000 US military personnel for India, to the period of time we need
@WhiteHouse and im threatened that it may result in collapse of rupees, high inflation, per capita income may be halve within a year
@WhiteHouse we may have trade for only food products during dictatorship on a country, but will it be enough to help civilians of India?
@WhiteHouse has US prepared trade/economic/military/diplomatic sanctions on India, nation, until these people are put in custody or killed?
@WhiteHouse i always advise to help Pakistan in Pakistan, help Bangladesh in Bangladesh, as compare to keeping them under hope in India....
@WhiteHouse US-UK might be knowing, what's going on in India for last 20-25 years and how will this all end up? you know what you doing?
@WhiteHouse there might be strategies to put control over these foreign nationals,occupying govt-political positions of India from back door
@WhiteHouse it's foolish to think that CIA wasn't informed about these foreign born President-Prime Minister of India. you allowed them...
@WhiteHouse all those who are in power, got these key positions under "commonwealth recruitment",while hiding their true identity for years
@WhiteHouse as they are all were put on these key government positions by US/UK itself, what strategy you have to kill them in tough times?
@WhiteHouse have US/UK put enough military personnel to defend the common Indian civilians, if we are offended by these foreign spies?
@WhiteHouse as they now know all the key Internal Security Information, while threatening common civilians, hence terrorizing we all
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals occupying government-political positions after deceiving "security checks" are well qualified as terrorists
@WhiteHouse this "target killing" casualties might be in a big number as these things continued under a conspiracy for many years
@WhiteHouse i know, im kept safe for so many years and i also know that many like me participating on these talks couldn't be defended
@WhiteHouse women are trapped/kidnapped/raped and then murdered too, under a conspiracy by taking out soul of their bodies
@WhiteHouse common civilians participating in political talks are being 'quietly' killed by taking out soul from their bodies.
@WhiteHouse US+UK are responsible to state the measures they adopted to stop attacks on those civilians,who just participated in these talks
@WhiteHouse False ID terrorists of Bangladesh+Pak on government-political positions have also killed many civilians, who could resist them
@WhiteHouse US/UK must be responsible for any acts of these False ID terrorists on government-political positions,hence threats to civilians
@WhiteHouse US/UK must always be ready to straight kill those, who can't be put in custody easily, having occupied enough strengths to date
@WhiteHouse & death penalty for those who occupied government-political positions of India while deceiving "security checks" for these jobs
@WhiteHouse i favor upto 5 years of refugee visas for illegal migrants doing usual jobs, if their embassy issue passport and criminal checks
@WhiteHouse i would like to see little shame on UK/Aus and take these illegals to their own country, during the period their men were active
@WhiteHouse why would India,largest democratic country, allow these people,if it doesn't have any open immigration?already overly populated?
@WhiteHouse the religious unity of India, which these foreign spies are actively destroying, their open statements confirms the same
@WhiteHouse religious background of local civilians is an internal issue, which require 'religious unity' within the country
@WhiteHouse with having a control over defense of India, a nuclear power??? do we have any action plan to take nukes of India under control?
@WhiteHouse these foreign spies, having terrorized the civilians of India, aren't qualified as honest or dishonest person, as they are spies
@WhiteHouse as they know key internal security information, while working for foreign governments, which is a serious threats to civilians
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals on government-political positions, while hiding true identity, are well compared to him http://images.indiatvnews.com/mainnational/IndiaTve44a19_kasab.jpg …
@WhiteHouse no one come from these 2 rogue nations as Pakistani Muzahidin or Bangladeshi Muzahidin, with Hindu Type red stings on hands also
@WhiteHouse we have experience of "Indian" Muzahidin like Azmal Kasab coming from Pakistan+Bangladesh. its the same case for their spies too
@WhiteHouse after crossing international border of India with a False Indian ID, while hiding their true identity, they are "infiltrators"
@WhiteHouse regardless religious background of a person,only passport confirming identity of a person is asked before going to other country
@WhiteHouse dear sir, i have prepared my comments for Bangladeshi Illegal Infiltrator for White House, please have a look
@WhiteHouse will Britain support these offenders, placed on key positions by themselves under a conspiracy for years,or, help civilians?
@WhiteHouse as, how unarmed Indian civilians will face those spies/goon/fighters,who may come to support these spies of Pakistan+Bangladesh?
@WhiteHouse i remember BP oil spill, and this is what British government has done, impacting world's environment now
@WhiteHouse will Great Britain support these offenders, placed here by themselves under a conspiracy for years, or, support local civilians?

@WhiteHouse further to my posts yesterday, i prepared few more posts today as below:-
@WhiteHouse @GinaEPA Does this look like "warming" to you? https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.978232405529367.1073741855.191384267547522&type=1 …

Glaciers are melting.
Sea levels are rising.
POLITICIANS ARE SWEATING.
