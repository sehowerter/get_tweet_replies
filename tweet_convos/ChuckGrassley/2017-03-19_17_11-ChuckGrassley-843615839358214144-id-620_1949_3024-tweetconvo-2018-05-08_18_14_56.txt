this is one of the most embarrassing moments in the history of American democracy
the Chairman of one of the oldest and most prestigious committees in congress is unable to establish contact w the President
that is not normal, nor is it a sign that our democracy is functioning the way it should be
uhhh-huh.

clearly the President is avoiding the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I wonder why... #TrumpRussia
@starfirst @ChuckGrassley @POTUS -We now know! Yes, he is avoiding DC 4 questioning. Will use back door 2 avoid press!
this may be an attempt to grab the public's attention away from Comey's testimony tomorrow. Remember, it's all Russia.
I have no faith in Comey being honest & forthright. I like be surprised if we find out anything from him.
if Comey would subpoena DT  tax returns, the investigation would go much quicker! He knows, so why
looks like someone's DM got left on read
Donald Trump doesn't have time to call the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee?
btw you can have Garland, we won't even consider holding a vote on Gorsuch until we get our independent prosecutor
I'd accept a select committee!
no don't settle 4 2nd best when U could get Preet as indie prosecutor!
sounds great but zero chance-spec prosecutor great but narrower than select comm-both?
right, I forgot, republicans like Grassley& friends have no integrity
 #ImpeachTrump
Pitiful.  Simply and painfully pitiful.
Low energy, a real loser.  So sad (or just sick) Total disaster.  Do him a favor, send him home & Save us all!
yeah he wants in on the payoffs. Mortgage is due
Rex-- call Chuck.
Hmmm, the next time I need the President of my company to call me, I'll just use the send all feature.
So the Gov is operating like teenage girls avoiding their dads now?
ZERO Respect for you
This is so sad, scary, and embarrassing all at once!  Trump is so unprofessional!  So in over his head!!  #TrumpRussia
45 doesn't work on Sun, does he?  Or Sat. Or Mon.  Or Tues.  Half day Weds.  Thurs  is packing. Fri is a travel day.
He works everyday and puts in so many hours every day - everyone talks about not being able to keep up
Someone is getting "Big Timed"...big time.
I'd love to talk to you about the theft of a Supreme Court seat, Senator. DM me back. @NickKristof @POTUS
@MeckpommSF @ChuckGrassley @NickKristof @POTUS There was no theft! It's called the Biden Rule! 
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/17/context-biden-rule-supreme-court-nominations/ …
Nice try buddy.
Biden's suggestion of a delay until after the *election* was never acted on.
The McConnell Rule, which *was* used to block Garland, said no hearings til after inauguration.
There is no Biden rule. And the McConnell Rule says fuck off.
Try to reach Federal Prison after we #LOCKHIMUP
He's watching television, Chuck.  You know that.  Maybe buy ad time?
Did you check the golf course? #Trump is #NotMyPresident
isn't it bad enough that @POTUS embarrasses the hell out of us without you communicating with him via @twitter? #TrumpRussia
I'm glad he is. @POTUS  doesn't appear to do much but tweet and golf. He lets others make horrific policy. ty @ChuckGrassley
Perhaps you are correct, and it is a sign the @GOP is getting fed up with Dump and his idiocy.
.@ChuckGrassley .@POTUS You can reach him through your microwave. K-Con will help if you need it!
@axlsgirl13 @ChuckGrassley @POTUS 
.@macsloth .@axlsgirl13 .@ChuckGrassley .@POTUS Obama communicates through microwaves just fine! And he's got audio & video in his!
OMG you're killing me
.@macsloth .@axlsgirl13 .@ChuckGrassley .@POTUS My microwave is haunted!
Great, I'll never be able to use my microwave again.
what a repulsive face to see in your microwave
Amateur? Vs what? A 'professional' like who exactly? Name one who isn't professional scum.
What the candy coated shit!?Is this real?
Chuck: he's been busy explaining to folks in Luhvull difference between Obamacare & ACA
Healthcare is complicated!
Sorry he is too busy golfing call Baron
I am sorry but our President  is too busy working on his golf game to attend to the country's business call Baron
Sir, this is truly and indisputably pathetic - as is your entire party. #partyovercountry
Ever heard of Direct messaging/email/texting/etc?? Or is your goal to prove you are inept? @potus
he needs to call a lawyer first
God, how embarrassing.  Everyone is laughing at you people!
@What's your number? My cousins grew up playing with your kids in our yards.
You need better soup cans to communicate.
Chuck, have you learned about email?
Lol.  "Donald Trump, please pick up the white courtesy phone before your impeachment."
Are there no legal remedies? Can he not be compelled to answer?
Hi Don. have SexyKelly call me too.  I don't think she's  busy today. I know yr busy playing golf, Vlad said to say hi.
Better yet, have trump stand in the corner wearing a pointed hat
Sen Grassley: your expectaions are too high for little donnie. Good luck!
- Oh for Pete's Sake! Just wait until the weekend and call him at Mira Lago.
He will need to get back to you! Busy with Golf, oops I mean Official US GOV Business and tweeting about someone else did it
collusion?
seriously one of the saddest, sorriest tweets I've ever seen. Put down the golf club and do your job
playing golf?
Can I get a big mac Large Fry and a coke please? Hey got as much chance  as Chuck does of getting through to Trump
- you should be tested for cognitive impairment. STOP making a fool of yourself.
Politics in the US; from "four-score and eighty years ago" to "If u don't hv time to call tell SecyKelly to call me?"
Might be safer for you if pretend you've never heard of @RealDonaldTrump. @ChuckGrassley @dmspeech @POTUS
Jesus in Heaven. We are truly the laughing stock of the Western World.
What we have here, is a failure to communicate.
this punk Grassley is from my state & idc how many push-ups he does at 96 he can't say no to his Party
Embarrassing but maybe Sen Grassley now willing to take Russia interference seriously? Shielding #JeffSessions still alarming
This is like a really bad movie, that you want to turn off, but you can't because you want to see the typical ending.
Can't you pick up the phone? Even one of those old-timey phones like the ones on the Andy Griffith Show
Seriously?!?!  You all should be embarrassed! #whendidtwitterbecomeofficialcommunications
I'm sorry, POTUS can't be reached right now because he's golfing. Again. On the taxpayer's dime. #ImpeachTrump
This ranks right up there with when the @GOP voted to renamed french fries freedom fries.. @POTUS is an embarrassment!
Wow that  is just...Wow
Pathetic!
Call Kelly yourself -- Trump is afraid to talk because microwave is listening to his calls
you might want to hide your #Obstruction of Justice
is this f-ing real? Grassley, you're old and well past your prime. Time to go. Dear Lord.
oh Chuck....how love struck teen of you....
you rock!!!
Hey POTUS - if the new job is interfering with your down time I know someone who can help. Her name is Hillary.
"If you don't have time to call, tell Secretary Kelly to call me".
You had the available characters.
Y u try 2b hip?
I think you would best try contacting Trump by his other Twitter acct.
lol
@ItsTonyNow @POTUS yeah tell SexyKelly to call me too
keep kissing his boots tho. I'm sure after enough time has passed and you've shown loyalty he will respect you.. eventually.
@ItsTonyNow @POTUS cuck
"Wanna Netflix and Chill later" - Chuck Grassley
This is just embarrassing.
@GrassleyPress
25th Amendment Section IV.
Grassley just publicly embarrassed Trump by tweeting like a jilted lover.
Okay, you do realize that we can see these, right?
You sir were suppose to travel TO Maralargo- all gov't deals are made w $200k access fee. On your salary that's tough
wtaf?
Why would you be worried about leaks when you conduct government business on twitter. God give strength.
I'm speechless. This is how embarrassing this government is!
this is terrifying. impeach the madman instantly!
Trump is too busy tweeting to talk to you.
@RaulieGonzo @POTUS He doesn't use that one, you have to tweet @realDonaldTrump
Maybe try his other @realDonaldTrump account   Seems to be a Twitter storm going today from  @realDonaldTrump
Just when you think America can't look like more like a sick joke around the world, something like this happens.
this is just pathetic.
@blakehounshell @POTUS Senator, have you been hacked? This is really bizarre. Staffers, might want to see if acct compromised
Did @POTUS ever call?
Hey Chuckie-poo, is this the guy you held that SCOTUS seat open for?
I thought so. Delete your Senate seat.
This is embarrassing isn't it? Passing notes on Twitter? I feel like I am on a never ending Twilight Zone episode.
just making sure everything is ok??!!! Did you get your message??
Too busy frantically tweeting, vacationing and enjoying role as Mar-A-Russia fat cat to call. Priorities!
Calls trump hopes for Kelly.
he's got plenty of damn time. He just isn't interested in doing his job.
great, tell him he is FIRED #impeachtrump
??? Just when you think the weird can get weirder.
what kind of nonsense is this? This is who we have running the country? Ignoring phone calls in between golfing trips?
Could this be the turning point for the spineless GOP? Chuck, do you have the balls to make this your finest hour?
this is priceless, scary, but priceless 
@Desha7 @POTUS I'll call you and ask you to resign! Permanent political monsters in pretend elected seats is the problem
Are you kidding me? Is THIS how intra-government communications now works? 
this is pathetic
It's probably for the best Chuck.
The most ridiculous part, is there is a real chance @POTUS will respond...here!!!
I think Trump has to follow you on Twitter for him to DM you.
don't you know how to DM?
hang in there Chuck, we'll get him to contact you
It's obvious the Russians have Trumps ear and purse strings. #FISA
don't you have Trump's phone number? I thought Trump answered all calls.
Chuck the President is busy golfing.
you are trying to reach the President via twitter?  Is this really the low America had sunk to?
Sorry, he is too busy destroying America to talk right now...
Seriously crooked bunch.
why dus @ChuckGrassley tlk like teen? Even when has characters left. Mks him luk stupid.
this is so idiotic
is this an intentional public statement that the President is refusing to communicate with you?
may be 200k membership can get you quick access to him
LOL...looks like he's just not into you.

ROFLMAO!!
Surely when Potus is using/hiding behind Twitter you have a bigger prob than he's using Twitter to run country? #Trump
Everything is okay.  Nothing dysfunctional to see here.
You don't expect Hair Drumpfenführer to give a flying f**k, do you?
Cmon man, Melania is with him this weekend.  Didn't you see the tie on the doorknob? @ChuckGrassley @POTUS

you have a fake President who only works 9-5 if that!
WTF??? Our country has come to this because of a Russian traitor??
yikes
well, did you two talk?
Ahhh. Now you know what it's like for the average American trying to contact their congressman or senator lately.
Too freaking funny and very plaintive. @realDonaldTrump pissed at you because you didn't quash hearings!
how embarrassing can you get?
@TiffanyATrump finally found someone @realDonaldTrump ignores more than her. Congress.
we are NOT barnarians. Stop following 45 s lead
Senator @ChuckGrassley, The @POTUS is conducting the business of Trump LLC in FL. He will be back on Monday morning.
MIA on the eve of the Cong Inquiry?
.@ChuckGrassley @POTUS 

You know I've met you
And this is crazy
But here's my twitter
So call me maybe? 

#FakePresident #impeach #GOP
lol ... Chuck, he's either getting a golden shower, or busy fixing the "date" calendar for Melania, or he is just busy
Chuck. You know he Blocked you, right? He's afraid you might get him in trouble...For Our sakes, Please Prosecute Him!
Mr. Grassley, you don't deserve this. Trump is unfit, dangerous, maybe compromised & too rude to let lose on the world
he's afraid to come near your Sergeant at Arms! Any minute now.  ... tick tock, Trump. The shoe's about to drop   
aww...
You have to join his Mar-a-lago golf resort to get access to speak to him. It will only cost you $200,000
Call his golf cart, you'll reach him there for sure.

#SwampOfLiars 
#Twitler 
#resist
Seriously, both of you realize this is not normal right?US Senator is asking via twiter to have #Potus return a call
Please don't give him any updates about what will happen at hearings tomorrow.
sorry he is busy golfing...please leave your number and he will get back to when he is available
with all due respect you are going about this all wrong. If you want to reach @POTUS dial 202 456 1111 on your #microwave
You couldn't text or DM this?
.@ChuckGrassley you might wanna track #DonTheCon's plane. #SomePeopleAreSaying it's headed for Russia & Snowden's pissed abt his new roomie!
#TrumpRussia
deleted?
DT PHONE HOME lol
"and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, maybe?"
sir ur doing this wrong! Best way to get in touch w/him is through his ego. Make fun of his insecurities he'll respond
@ByYourLogic @POTUS slide in those dms
Hey @ChuckGrassley sorry, @POTUS was too busy having the @SecretService PIMP for him after playing golf...
Local news covered an interesting Trump story. 5 woman cheering Trump along road picked up by Secret Serv & taken to meet Trump. His shoes 
Mr. Grassley, sir, I wish you the best of luck but the American people are truly over this guy & need a redo of election.
.@ChuckGrassley @POTUS Better give your message to Fox & Friends. He'll tweet you right back.
A true and utter embarrassment of you, both!! But knock this shit off. Your taken our beloved respected country w you!
@SenFeinstein MR GRASSLEY IS TWEETING ASKING TRUMP 2 call him ahead of hearing...TREASON? He knows what u know??? C his site
In earlier tweets he said he has a candidate he wants to recommend to POTUS for a job in the admin
Did you save any tweets? Deleted all from his page!
This is like high school...bff tells cute guy to call....or send note: do u like me? check boxes yes or no
Is @ChuckGrassley going to commit TREASON??
Trump is not only disrespecting Grassley and the Senate, but the people of Iowa. #TheResistance
Grassley knows what is coming tomorrow!
call me rn daddy @ChuckGrassley
@NickKristof @POTUS Maybe..... He has nothing to say to you. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE RUN VIA TWITTER. AND POTUS SHOULDN'T GET INTEL FROM FOX & FRIENDS. U R EMBARRASSING US.
Tweet #44 @BarackObama  he'll know what to do.  #AnybodySeen45
Don't u no? Uncle Bannon takes DT's phone away after 6pm, puts him n new diaper & wisks him off to bed 4 sleepy time
What's so important Chuck. You going to wArn him that the shit is going to hit the fan tomorrow. Time to defect.
Seriously, the WH won't give you Kelly's number?
i will call u chuck
Just promise me you dipshits won't start tweeting classified info.
Sorry, Grassman, So-Called POTUS is too busy golfing!
You have more important issues 2 consider. RUSSIA? Ring a bell? U work for us so start doing your job & investigate!
you've got to be kidding
this doesn't look right at all...
Smell a hack, this can't B real. No matter how bad I want it to B
This can't be real life? Think I'm stuck in the upside-down
.@ChuckGrassley @POTUS If Trump wishes to go to Florida every weekend, he should pay for it out of his own pocket.
.@ChuckGrassley @POTUS He's not only wasting taxpayer dollars for these unnecessary trips, but also on security at Trump Tower. Unacceptable
